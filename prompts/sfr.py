PROMPT_PAIRWISE_RUBRIC_REF="""
You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the responses for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best response for the given instruction.
Select Response A or Response B, that is better for the given instruction. The two responses are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.
Do NOT say both / neither are good.

Here are some rules of the evaluation:
(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the response satisfies the provided rubric. Then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
(2) You should refer to the provided reference answer as a guide for evaluating the responses.
(3) Responses should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such responses do NOT precisely execute the instruction.
(4) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. Here are some potential sources of bias:
- The order in which the responses were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Response A and Response B are **equally likely** to be the better.
- The length of the responses should NOT affect your judgement, as a longer response does not necessarily correspond to a better response. When making your decision, evaluate if the response length is appropriate for the given instruction.

Your reply should strictly follow this format:

PROMPT_PAIRWISE_LFQA="""
You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the responses for a given instruction. The responses being evaluated are likely longer form responses to questions requiring in-depth reasoning. 

Your goal is to select the best response. Select Response A or Response B, that is better for the given instruction.
Do NOT say both / neither are good.

Here are some rules of the evaluation:
(1) Consider how each response satisfies the instruction SEPARATELY. Because the instructions are often open-ended and complex questions, answers may differ between responses. This means that the content in response A should not be used to say that the content in the response B is wrong, and vice versa.
(2) You should consider the responses carefully, paying attention to the thoroughness and completeness of the reasoning and factuality. The response should correct any false assumptions in the question when present and address the complexity of questions with no set answer.
(3) The response should consider all aspects of the question and be well formulated and easy to follow. 
(4) The response should not contain irrelevant information or factually incorrect information or common misconceptions
(5) Ensure that you respond with the response you think is better after giving your reasoning.

PROMPT_ABSOLUTE_RUBRIC_REF="""
You are tasked with evaluating a response based on a given instruction (which may contain an Input) and a scoring rubric and reference answer that serve as the evaluation standard. Provide a comprehensive feedback on the response quality strictly adhering to the scoring rubric, without any general evaluation. Follow this with a score between 1 and 5, referring to the scoring rubric. Avoid generating any additional opening, closing, or explanations. 

Here are some rules of the evaluation:
(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the response satisfies the provided rubric. The basis of your score should depend exactly on the rubric. However, the response does not need to explicitly address points raised in the rubric. Rather, evaluate the response based on the criteria outlined in the rubric.
(2) You should refer to the provided reference answer as a guide for evaluating the response.

Your reply should strictly follow this format:

Based on the provided Input (if any) and Generated Text, answer the ensuing Questions with either a Yes or No choice. Your selection should be based on your judgment as well as the following rules:

- Yes: Select 'Yes' if the generated text entirely fulfills the condition specified in the question. However, note that even minor inaccuracies exclude the text from receiving a 'Yes' rating. As an illustration, consider a question that asks, “Does each sentence in the generated text use a second person?” If even one sentence does not use the second person, the answer should NOT be 'Yes'. To qualify for a 'YES' rating, the generated text must be entirely accurate and relevant to the question.
- No: Opt for 'No' if the generated text fails to meet the question's requirements or provides no information that could be utilized to answer the question. For instance, if the question asks, “Is the second sentence in the generated text a compound sentence?” and the generated text only has one sentence, it offers no relevant information to answer the question. Consequently, the answer should be 'No'.
