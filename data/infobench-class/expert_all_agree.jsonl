It's the only planet where we can find the element that can save our planet from the impending alien invasion.\n\nScene 2:\n\nLocation: X-32\n\nCharacters: Dr. Sarah and Professor John\n\nDr. Sarah: (Astonished) Look at this planet, it's so beautiful.\n\nProfessor John: (Focused) We don't have much time, we need to find the element and leave.\n\nDr. Sarah: (Curiously) But what if we get stuck here?\n\nProfessor John: (Confidently) Don't worry, the time machine will bring us back to the exact moment we left Earth.\n\nScene 3:\n\nLocation: X-32\n\nCharacters: Dr. Sarah, Professor John, and an Alien\n\nDr. Sarah: (Shocked) Look, an alien.\n\nProfessor John: (Defensively) Be careful, we don't know if it's friendly.\n\nAlien: (Communicating telepathically) I come in peace. My planet was destroyed by the same aliens that are invading your planet.\n\nDr. Sarah: (Surprised) Can you help us find the element we need?\n\nAlien: (Agreeing) Yes, I know where it is.

We have the element that can save us.\n\nProfessor John: (Decisively) But we need to power up the time machine to go back in time and prevent the invasion from happening.\n\nScene 2:\n\nLocation: Earth\n\nCharacters: Dr. Sarah, Professor John, General Richards, and the Alien\n\nDr. Sarah: (Frantically) We need to hurry, the aliens are getting closer.\n\nProfessor John: (Desperately) We need to overload the time machine to create a time vortex that will send us back to the moment before the invasion started.\n\nGeneral Richards: (Determined) I'll stay behind and fight the aliens. You guys go and save our planet.\n\nAlien: (Resolutely) I'll help you power up the time machine.\n\nScene 3:\n\nLocation: Earth\n\nCharacters: Dr. Sarah, Professor John, and the Alien\n\nDr. Sarah: (Hopeful) We did it, we're back in time.\n\nProfessor John: (Relieved) Now we need to find a way to prevent the invasion.\n\nAlien: (Enlightened) I have an idea. We can use the element to create a weapon that can destroy the alien mothership.\n\nAct Three:\n\nScene 1:\n\nLocation: Earth\n\nCharacters: Dr. Sarah, Professor John, General Richards, and the Alien\n\nGeneral Richards: (Proudly) We did it. The alien invasion has been stopped.\n\nDr. Sarah: (Grateful) We couldn't have done it without the help of our alien friend.\n\nProfessor John: (Curiously) How did you know about the time vortex?\n\nAlien: (Confidently) My planet was destroyed by the same aliens that invaded your planet. We developed a time machine to go back in time and stop them, but it failed. I knew the only way to stop them was to help you.\n\nScene 2:\n\nLocation: Earth\n\nCharacters: Dr. Sarah, Professor John, and the Alien\n\nDr. Sarah: (Sad) We have to leave now.\n\nProfessor John: (Grateful) Thank you for your help. We'll never forget what you did for us.\n\nAlien: (Humbled) It was my pleasure to help.\n\nScene 3:\n\nLocation: X-32\n\nCharacters: Dr. Sarah and Professor John\n\nDr. Sarah: (Reflectively) We owe our planet's survival to that alien.\n\nProfessor John: (Proudly) And to ourselves for building the time machine.\n\nDr. Sarah: (Remorseful) But we lost General Richards.\n\nProfessor John: (Respectfully) He made the ultimate sacrifice for the greater good.\n\nDr. Sarah: (Hopefully) Let's go home and make sure our planet never faces another invasion again.\n\nThe End.", "question": "Does the generated play include self-sacrifice for the greater good of at least one character?

Exhale and release any tension or discomfort. \n\nNow, focus on your breath. Take a deep breath in through your nose, and exhale through your mouth.

This polarity allows water to form hydrogen bonds, which contribute to its high heat capacity, surface tension, and cohesion. Water also acts as a solvent, dissolving a wide range of substances, including salts, sugars, acids, and gases. Its density decreases upon freezing, causing ice to float on its liquid form.

Our journey to the Earth's core was on the verge of commencement. My team, a group of seasoned geologists, engineers, and biologists, had spent years researching and preparing for this moment. The hatch closed, and the descent began.\n\nThe initial layer we encountered was the Earth's crust. It was the most familiar to us, as it was the layer upon which all life existed. The crust varied in thickness from 5 kilometers beneath the ocean floor to about 70 kilometers beneath the continents. As the Proteus plunged deeper, the temperature gradually increased, and the rock formations surrounding us transitioned from sedimentary to igneous. We marveled at the intricate patterns formed by the solidified magma, now frozen in time.\n\nAs we continued our descent, we breached the boundary of the Earth's mantle. This vast, rocky layer extended approximately 2,900 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface. Our instruments indicated that the temperatures were now hovering around 1,000 degrees Celsius. The vessel's reinforced hull and advanced cooling system allowed us to continue our journey safely. We observed the slow, churning movements of the mantle, a mixture of solid and molten rock. The convection currents within this layer were responsible for the movement of tectonic plates on the Earth's surface. We were witnessing the very engine that drove earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nDeeper still, we entered the Earth's outer core. This was a momentous occasion, as no human had ever ventured this deep before. The outer core, a molten mixture of iron and nickel, spanned approximately 2,200 kilometers in thickness. The temperature soared to 4,000 degrees Celsius, and the pressure was now a staggering 1.3 million times greater than on the Earth's surface. The Proteus proved to be a marvel of engineering, as it withstood these extreme conditions. We floated in awe of the swirling metallic ocean, its currents generating Earth's magnetic field. The knowledge that we were experiencing the birthplace of the planet's protective shield was both humbling and exhilarating.\n\nFinally, after weeks of travel, we reached our destination: the Earth's inner core. This solid, iron-nickel sphere had a radius of about 1,220 kilometers and a temperature of nearly 5,700 degrees Celsius. We had reached the very heart of our planet. Observing the inner core, we noted the immense pressure that caused the iron and nickel to remain solid despite the intense heat. Our team collected invaluable data that would provide new insights into the Earth's formation and its magnetic field.\n\nWith our mission complete, we began the long ascent back to the surface. Each layer we traversed offered new understanding and appreciation for the complexity and beauty of our planet.

He can jump to any index which is at most `k` steps ahead from his current position. Bob wants to reach the last step of the array in the minimum number of jumps. Help Bob find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last step.\n\nWrite a function `min_jumps` to solve the problem.\n\n```python\ndef min_jumps(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n    pass\n```\n\n**Input**\n- A list `nums` (2 <= len(nums) <= 1000) of non-negative integers, where each integer n (0 <= n <= 10^9) represents a step.\n- An integer `k` (1 <= k <= len(nums)), representing the maximum number of steps Bob can jump ahead.\n\n**Output**\n- Return an integer representing the minimum number of jumps required for Bob to reach the last step of the array. If it is not possible to reach the last step, return -1.\n\n**Examples**\n\n```python\nassert min_jumps([2, 3, 1, 1, 4], 2) == 2\nassert min_jumps([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3) == 2\nassert min_jumps([2, 0, 1, 0, 4], 2) == -1\nassert min_jumps([1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 1) == 4\nassert min_jumps([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1) == -1\n```\n\n**Note**\n- In the first example, Bob can jump from index 0 to index 1, and then from index 1 to index 4, which is the last step. So, the minimum number of jumps is 2.\n- In the second example, Bob can jump from index 0 to index 2, and then from index 2 to index 4, which is the last step. So, the minimum number of jumps is 2.\n- In the third example, Bob cannot reach the last step, so the output is -1.", "question": "Are the generated examples helpful in explaining the generated programming problem?
