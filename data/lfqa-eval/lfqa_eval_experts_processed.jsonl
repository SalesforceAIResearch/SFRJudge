{"question": "I remember learning about an ex prisoner who was brought to America to help train the soldiers. But the details escape me. Can anyone provide details to who he was?", "answer_a": "Those clues are kind of vague, but one possible candidate *might* be Casimir Pulaski. He was an effective cavalry officer who was embroiled in the chaos of Poland in the later 18th c. and fought on a losing side, but while he was tried and condemned and his possessions confiscated, he'd fled to France  by then. So, \"ex prisoner\" is not *quite* correct. But he did indeed help train American cavalry- and irritated quite a few who served with him with his imperious manner. If you heard about him in the US, it might be because there are a lot of towns named after him, and he became quite a popular hero to later Polish-Americans.<br />Pienkos, A. (1976).

He was the son of Sacagawea and Toussaint Charbonneau, and accompanied the Lewis and Clark expedition as a young child.<br />Jean-Baptiste was born in 1805 and captured by the Hidatsa tribe at a young age. He spent several years living with the Hidatsa before being traded to the Lewis and Clark expedition in exchange for horses. Lewis and Clark took him under their wing, and he spent the next several years traveling with them across the country.<br />In 1811, the expedition returned to St. Louis and Jean-Baptiste was placed in the care of William Clark. Clark helped to educate him and arranged for him to be trained as a blacksmith.<br />Jean-Baptiste spent the next few years working as a blacksmith in St. Louis. In 1823, he was hired by the US government to help train soldiers at Fort Atkinson in Wisconsin. He continued to work as a blacksmith and soldier until his death in 1866.", "label": 1}

{"question": "What were the differences (if any) in the standard protective finishes on firearms from WWI to WWII?<br />I'm struggling to find conclusive details on the protective finishes used on historical firearms.<br />While browning has been around for centuries, blueing seems to be almost universally preferred for firearms. However, I can't find any reliable sources on exactly how these firearms were protected. Some say they were blued, others that they just slapped on a load of radiator paint. Still others talk about anodising but that seems unlikely to me based on examples I've seen. I've also heard that they simply weren't protected at all, notably with the Sten gun.", "answer_a": "As you likely have noticed, there are LOTS of ways to blue a firearm. What makes it confusing is that both browning and blueing are making an iron oxide layer, and a blued finish will, on exposure to the elements ( like, someone goes hunting) bit by bit revert to regular brown rust, so quite a lot of guns are now brown that were once blue ( there's a gunsmith invocation over blueing: \"from rust you came, to rust you shall return\"). <br />In the later 1800's it was discovered that a phosphate coating could be created that was more stable than blueing or browning. The patent history is a bit complex, but the process was made practical after 1900, and in 1918 the Parker Rust-Proof Company started up in Detroit. Because of them , the finish has since generally been called parkerizing, and it was adopted by Springfield Armory and contractors as the standard finish on US small arms in WWII, like the Garand, the 1911A1 automatic pistol, the 1903A3 rifle.  I'm afraid I don't know if any other countries used it, however: I think a blued finish was the most common elsewhere. <br />Even though the patents have long expired, the Parker Company still exists, and has a [website](https://www.parkerhq.com/about-us)<br />Angier, R.

{"question": "When the joint-stock company was first invented, was there a lot of pushback on the concept? What were some of the concerns?  Also any recommended books on the invention of the concept would be much appreciated!", "answer_a": "An early form of joint stock ventures appeared in Assyria by the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE. There does not seem to have been any noticeable pushback against the concept, although trade caravans were often taxed heavily. Of course, the relevant texts were written to and from people engaged in trade, so there's no way of knowing what other Assyrians thought of long distance trade. <br />>Most of these traders had become more independent by having become managers of a \"joint-stock fund\" (called *naruqqum*, \"money bag\"), usually set up in Assur. This phenomenon appeared for the first time around 1900 BC and seems to have been an Old Assyrian invention that went beyond individual partnerships and cooperation in a joint caravan. The arrangement, rather similar to that of the early medieval *compagnia*, meant enlisting a number (usually about a dozen) of investors (*ummiānum*, \"financiers\"), who supplied capital rated in gold, usually in all ca. 30 kilos, ideally consisting of shares of 1 or 2 kilos of gold each. It was entrusted to a trader (the tractator), usually for ca. ten years, for the generally formulated purpose of \"carrying out trade.\" The contract contained stipulations on a final settlement of accounts, on paying dividends, on the division of the expected profit, and on fines for premature withdrawal of capital (meant to secure the duration of the business). Investors or shareholders mostly lived in Assur, but successful traders in Anatolia too invested in funds managed by others, perhaps also as a way of sharing commercial risks. In such cases a contract would to be drawn up in Anatolia that obliged the tractator \"to book in Assur x gold in his joint stock fund in the investor's name.\" Among the investors we find members of the tractator's family, but also business relations and others, probably a kind of \"merchant-bankers,\" and other rich citizens, who aimed at fairly safe, long-term investments.<br />[\"Ancient Assur: The City, its Traders, and its Commercial Network\"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25651212) by Klaas Veenhof<br />For more on Old Assyrian trade and these early joint stock funds, see [*Ancient Kanesh: A Merchant Colony in Bronze Age Anatolia*](https://books.google.com/books?id=qXGgCgAAQBAJ) by Mogens Larsen.", "answer_b": "There was definitely some pushback when the joint-stock company was first invented.

Would one or both of these have been fictional stories told as jokes? Might Lincoln have taken the story from Madison? Or was this a common way that these job seekers asked for stuff?", "answer_a": "It is possible that Madison and Lincoln were both telling jokes, as it is common for politicians to tell stories to make a point. It is also possible that Lincoln took the story from Madison, as he was known to borrow stories from others. It is also possible that this was a common way for job seekers to ask for things, as it would have been a way to get the attention of the person they were asking.", "answer_b": "From the outset of the new US, every change in administration would result in a new chance for government posts to be awarded.  Of all the Founding Fathers. Madison was the consummate deal maker, and it's easy to imagine the story originating with him. <br /> But Andrew Jackson was the most notorious practitioner of awarding posts to friends:  before him, chances were at least pretty good that a Federalist would be able to keep his job if a Democratic President came to power. But Jackson wanted a bureaucracy loyal to him, correctly saw that rewarding office seekers with positions was a way to gain political support in their regions, and was quick to terminate people in order to get it. By Lincoln's administration, it was very much expected that a there would be a major turnover in positions coming in with his election, so your story was certainly a joke- a wry one, as Lincoln had plenty of men hanging about the White House getting in his way, hoping for just such a chance.  But the joke had a point, both for Madison and Lincoln- there had to be a quid pro quo, as the office seeker was expected to bring some local influence, bring the support of a Congressman, an electoral district; something useful. A man without influence might well only be able to beg for a pair of pants.<br />Real civil service reform was begun by Garfield, and after he was shot by an office seeker, carried on to everyone's surprise by  Chester A. Arthur.

{"question": "Has there been any battles in history where both sides were completely and mutually destroyed?", "answer_a": "In normal conditions, this would not happen, since casualty rates in historical battles are rarely that extreme. In ancient warfare the defeated side might incur something like 10-20% casualties unless things went disastrously wrong. In modern warfare a unit that has lost more than 30% effectives is considered unfit for action.<br />Most of the time, the deciding factor is morale. Warriors simply aren't going to keep on fighting when they see their buddies falling left and right and they see no way of turning things around. They're going to try to get out of there, find a place of safety, and regroup if they can; or they're going to surrender. When the situation is hopeless, most armies will give up the fight, and this will happen long before they come anywhere near total annihilation. In fact, in premodern warfare the great majority of casualties were sustained when the side that broke first was fleeing from the battlefield with the victorious side in hot pursuit.<br />So, given these conditions, what would you need to achieve mutual destruction? You'd need two sides that were roughly evenly matched and utterly determined never to give up. The necessary attitude may sometimes be found among the last defenders of a town or fortress, but of course you would never get two such forces fighting each other; in most cases where one side is prepared to fight to the end, the other side is vastly superior and not similarly inclined. The result would be either the annihilation of the defenders or the flight of the attackers - never mutual destruction.<br />There is one case from Greek history that meets your requirements, though, by virtue of being artificially created and utterly exceptional: the so-called Battle of the Champions, fought around 550 BC between the Spartans and the Argives (Herodotos 1.82). When the two armies met, they agreed to settle their dispute over a border region by each choosing 300 champions, and letting those men fight it out. It seems these picked forces were a match for each other, because all 600 men died, except for two Argives and one Spartan. At that point the two Argives left the battlefield and declared themselves victorious. The Spartan stayed behind, stripped the dead of their armour, and declared himself victorious. <br />There is no other example of a prearranged battle like this in Greek history. The reason is obvious: it was a complete failure, since the two sides couldn't agree on who had won, and in the end they decided to launch their whole armies into an all-out battle anyway. But because of the artificial conditions and the dedication of the 600 champions, it's the closest a battle ever got to complete destruction on both sides.", "answer_b": "There have been a few instances in history where both sides in a battle were completely and mutually destroyed. One example is the Battle of Cannae during the Second Punic War, in which the Carthaginian forces led by Hannibal annihilated a much larger Roman army. Another example is the Battle of Agincourt during the Hundred Years' War, in which the English forces led by Henry V defeated a much larger French army.", "label": 1}

{"question": "I was wondering if there was any historical references of a Leader employing a humanitarian crisis as a trap for an invading force in the way that the fictional character Marco Inaros succeeded to do on the Expanse?<br />Spoiler for anyone who intends on watching season 6, episode 3 of the Expanse, but I want to find if this was uniquely fictitious or if there’s very real historical events I could also explore. Without needing to see the Expanse, I will give a quick run down of what happened:<br />As two navies fight for control in space, Earth vs the Outer Belt “Free Navy,” the Earth force intends to invade the Capitol city of Ceres station. It was important to establish a foothold in future attacks. Upon arrival, the invaders find that the city has been stripped of all food and supplies, and the residents left with only a few weeks of food before they would starve to death. What appeared to be an effortless victory ended as a humanitarian crisis draining resources and entrapping the Earth navy in a PR nightmare instead of decisive victory. <br />Has this ever been deployed in real life? Maybe in WWII with the prison camps or possibly (and if it’s against the rules to mention, please skip), but modern times fall of Baghdad in the recent war in Iraq be considered a similar ploy?

Definitely not on purpose but had a similar effect. That’s awesome. I’m going to keep the thread open for any other historical references but I do appreciate this and it’s 1 more than I expected to get", "answer_b": "I mean, it was definitely not intentional, but as Confederate armies retreated from the banks of the Mississippi, along which some of the South's wealthiest and largest plantations were located, the Union was left guarding an enormous expanse, filled with tens of thousands of freedmen that desperately needed food, medicine and clothing. This created a giant humanitarian crisis that the Union Army was ill-equipped to handle. Their best attempts were to put the freedmen into \"Contraband Camps\" that were rife with disease and unsanitary conditions. Another approach was to lease abandoned and confiscated plantations to Northern factors, who would then employ the freedmen to grow cotton. But in any case the crisis was never completely solved, and it proved to be a constant drain in Union resources and manpower, an embarrassment for the Lincoln administration, and a military factor in that the need to patrol the territory diverted thousands of troops and occasionally had adverse effects in military operations. <br />However, this was not an intentional ploy on the part of the Confederates. If they had gotten their way the Union would never have occupied those territories, and the people they enslaved would have remained in their plantations under their control. The freedmen who remained and thus came under Union protection did so not because of the Confederates but in spite of them, as they refused to flee with their masters. Instead, they abandoned the plantations and entered Union lines, or alternately, knowing that the Union would soon take control of the plantation, remained there, defying attempts to \"refugee\" them. Moreover, most of the outrage in reaction of the terrible conditions in the camps came from Northern abolitionists - people the Southerners despised.", "label": 2}

In some cases, metal roads can also refer to roads that are coated with a layer of asphalt or other bituminous materials. <br />The term \"metal road\" is believed to have originated in the early 19th century, when roads were first being improved with compacted materials like gravel and stone.

They looked for ladies of virtue, beauty and respectable background (no crimes, magic, medicine, trade, handcraft) of between 13-20 sui. Leading families could either present their daughters to the inspectors or make arrangements to skip that, controllers and Dowagers inserting their own candidates (who just happened to be related). Also not unknown for an Emperor in the civil war when Han Empire collapsed  to spot someone they fancied, marriage via conquest, a \"we are sorry we rebelled, have this lady\"<br />In terms of background, the Later Han had background restrictions and any uncertainty, like with the He family who was the first from outside a certain seven families, could lead to rumours.

{"question": "I have read on this subreddit before that it was not unheard of for medieval nuns writing about Jesus and God in very erotic, or seemingly erotic, terms. I was wondering if there is any compiled lists of this medieval thirst poetry or what are some more famous examples of it?", "answer_a": "Yes, this was absolutely a thing – and a reasonably widespread thing at that. Quite a lot of medieval religious women practiced aversion of mystical theology which incorporated a significant erotic element. This tended to revolve around casting Jesus as a bridegroom figure, with whomthe mystic envisioned themselves achieving spiritual, mystical union with. It’s worth noting that it was by no means only women practicing this kind of spiritual experience. Indeed, one of the most prominent examples of this practice is St Bernard of Clairvaux’s (1090-1153) sermons on the Song of Songs, in which he makes use of strongly sexualised imagery to describe union with Christ (and then promptly chastises his audience for their dirty minds – good consistentapproach there Bernard, A+).<br />However, it’s certainly the women who are the most famous for this practice, and it does seem to have been a largely female (andcertainly feminised) form of mysticism. To the best of my knowledge, there’s not a compiled list, simply because there’s a huge amount of the stuff. Poetry is prominent, but there’s also many prose accounts of mystical visions and experiences. There is an (important) caveat that the actual writer of these experiences can differ – in some cases it is the mystic herself, but in many other it’s a male (usually mendicant) confessor or spiritual director. This can be a very significant filter on the voice that we can access, and can play a part in homogenising or “flattening” the texts.<br />In terms of the content, “thirst poetry” is an interesting modern analogy, but it’s important to remember that the erotic content of works like this is (at least theoretically) very much the means to the end, which is complete and total union with the divine. Much mystical theology works in an apophatic way – this means that God is conceptualised as the ultimate negative, completely unknown and unknowable. Due to this fundamentally unreachable nature, a variety of intellectual strategies are employed to try and bridge this epistemological gap, of which the use of the erotic mode of expression is just one. It’s also worth noting that one could quite equally look at some of this “erotic” language and categorise it as being about violent behaviour instead. See for example Beatrice of Nazareth’s description of love:<br />*“Meantime, when love acts in the heart so vehemently and riotously, it becomes so excessive and exuberant in the soul that the soul thinks its heart has been wounded in many and grave ways.... So it seems that its veins are opened and its blood is boiling out, its marrow is withered and its legs are weak, its chest burns and its throat is dry.... And the soul thus feels love acting riotously within it, sparing nothing, uncontrollably seizing and consuming everything within the soul like a devouring fire…”*<br />Or Mechthild of Magdeburg’s description of the union with the Godhead:<br />*“She is captured in the first experience*  <br />*When God kisses her in sweet union.*  <br />*She is assailed with many a holy thought*  <br />*That she not waver when she mortifies her flesh.*  <br />*She is bound by the power of the Holy Spirit,*  <br />*And her bliss is indeed manifold.*  <br />*She is slapped with the great powerlessness*  <br />*Of not being able to enjoy without interruption eternal light”*<br />I’m not saying these works are *about* violence specifically, just that they’re not either uncomplicatedly erotic, or using eroticism as the primary meaning of the text.<br />Famous examples – probably the most widely known these days are Margery Kempe (experiencing something of a renaissance recently) and St Catherine of Siena. Examples do, however, multiply - Dorothea of Montau, Marguerite Porete, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch of Antwerp – the list goes on. I’d suggest that Kempe and St Catherine are probably the easiest to find editions of the complete text, though I’d not swear to that.<br />If you want some good reading on the subject, a classic text is C. Walker-Bynum, *Fragmentation and Redemption* (New York: Zone Books, 1992). A broader (and possibly more accessible) work is E. A. Petroff (ed), *Medieval Women’s Visionary Literature*, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986).

First, hunger and homelessness are complex problems that require more than just financial resources to solve. Addressing hunger and homelessness requires a coordinated effort from governments, NGOs, and private individuals and organizations. Second, even if the world's richest people were to donate all of their wealth to ending hunger and homelessness, it would not be enough. The scale of the problem is simply too large. It is estimated that it would cost $30 billion per year to end hunger, and $20 billion per year to end homelessness. Third, the world's richest people are not all philanthropists. Some may be reluctant to donate their wealth to causes like ending hunger and homelessness, because they do not believe that these problems can be solved, or because they do not think it is their responsibility to solve them.", "answer_b": "He doesn't have enough money, not nearly enough.<br />700M people live is World Bank \"extreme poverty\", less than $2 per day in total income.

Why do some countries use such large denominations?", "answer_a": "It is actually the inflation's side effect.<br />The money worth less than the paper they paint it on. So, they use a higher number.<br />You can see how it begins (again) in Turkish Lira. In 2007, Turkey removed 6 zeroes from the money (ie 10 million TLs become 10 TLs). The $/TL was something like 1.20.<br />Now, $/TL is 8.65. TL loses it's worth. <br />To somewhat counter that, countries issue higher bills. So that the minimum wages can keep up against the inflation and people can afford basic stuff like electricity bills and such.", "answer_b": "There are a few reasons why some countries might choose to measure their currency in large units. One reason is that it can help to combat inflation. When prices are rising rapidly, it can be difficult to keep track of the value of goods and services if the currency is divided into small units. It can also be difficult to make change for small purchases. If the currency is measured in larger units, it can be easier for people to keep track of the value of goods and services and to make change. Another reason for using large units of currency is that it can make transactions more efficient. For example, if you are buying a car for $1,000, it is more efficient to pay in one $1,000 bill than to pay in ten $100 bills. Finally, large units of currency can also make it easier to track money laundering and other illicit financial activities. If all transactions are conducted in large units of currency, it can be easier to track the flow of money and to identify suspicious activity.", "label": 2}
{"question": "How are countries in billions of dollars in debt? Who do they owe? I’ve never really understood this. Do all these countries borrow money from each other back and forth? Tf is going on?", "answer_a": "Most debt is in the form of treasury bonds, which are essentially IOU's from the government in question. Basically, the government sells a bond to someone, and after a set amount of time that bond can be redeemed for it's face value, and with interest. The functional value of a bond is built entirely on the value of the government (or company) that backs the bond; if that government is perceived as stable, then the bond retains value, because there's a perception that the bond will be paid when it comes due.<br />In turn, bonds are an investment.

Money is an abstract idea that represents a unit of exchange. It is a tool that we use to buy and sell goods and services.<br /><br />The value of money is based on trust. People trust that money will retain its value over time, and that it can be used to purchase goods and services. Money is also a store of value, meaning it can be saved and used in the future.<br /><br />The supply of money is limited. Central banks can print more money, but this can cause inflation, which reduces the value of money. Money is also a scarce resource, which is why we use it as a unit of exchange.<br /><br />There are different types of money, including fiat money, commodity money, and cryptocurrency. Fiat money is money that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver. Commodity money is money that is backed by a physical commodity.

For example, Japanese Yen, Central African Francs and other currencies all have exchange rates to USD/GBP of decimal places. Why can't 1 CAF or JPY = 1 USD/GBP?", "answer_a": "One of the main reasons why currencies can't change their value to be in line with other currencies is because of the different economic conditions in different countries. For example, Japan has a much stronger economy than the Central African Republic, so the Japanese Yen is worth more than the Central African Franc. If all currencies were worth the same, then it would be very difficult for people to trade goods and services between different countries.", "answer_b": "They can, but that would require effort by someone.

If so, I’m sure quite a bit of currency was withdrawn from circulation, as well.", "answer_b": "There are a few reasons why the inflation rate is not 20% despite the fact that 20% of all US dollars were printed in the last year. First, it takes time for new money to enter the economy and start circulating. Second, not all of the new money will end up being used to purchase goods and services; some of it may be saved or used to pay off debt, for example.

Is that true?<br />If so, such calculation leads us to a flat tax rate. If we are talking about a progressive tax, how are the decisions about tax bands and rates for each band made?", "answer_a": "Governments use a variety of methods to determine tax rates. In some cases, rates are set based on the amount of money the government needs to raise to fund specific programs or initiatives. In other cases, tax rates may be based on a percentage of income, with higher earners paying a higher rate. Additionally, some governments use a progressive tax system, in which tax rates increase as income increases.", "answer_b": "You'd be wrong.<br />The legislature gets input from economic calculations, in the US from the Congressional Budget Office, but more often than not the numbers are chosen to send political messages.<br />There are very, very few flat tax systems.  Almost all systems are extremely progressive, what's the point of collecting taxes from some poor person who you make social safety net payments to?  That would just be government using taxes to collect its own money.  Tax bands are set politically, trading off the influence of the rich with the influence of the anti-rich.

The managers of the fund (investment experts... usually... hopefully) pool all of the money from individual investors (you) and use it to buy/invest in the stocks. Any gains that the fund makes through regular \"buy low,sell high\" or dividends are split back to the individual fund investors (you) in proportion of units held. <br />The fund managers will charge a small amount for their \"expertise\" but otherwise just invest and manage according to the mutual fund's portfolio mandate.

Is it that the only purpose of tax today is redistribution of wealth?", "answer_a": "There are a few reasons why countries with a fiat currency still use tax. First, tax revenue is one of the main ways that governments fund public goods and services. Without tax revenue, governments would have to rely on other sources of funding, which might not be as stable or reliable. Second, tax helps to reduce income inequality by redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor. This is especially important in countries with a large income gap between the rich and the poor.

{"question": "Would burning money help with the inflation problem in Venezuela for example? ", "answer_a": "No.<br />Paper money is a tiny fraction of the actual money.

So I raise my prices today to protect myself against currency changes in the future. This of course spirals out of control because everyone starts doing this.<br />Because the value is changing fast, there is no point saving money, so everyone tries to spend all their money at once before it's value is rapidly eroded to zero. Often money will be spent the same day it is earned - and everyone spending every penny every day pushes up prices more and the cycle continues. <br />The only way to fix the issue is to make people trust the currency again.

{"question": "There is all this talk about global USD shortage despite trillions that were printed in the last 2 years, what gives? ", "answer_a": "If you go back in time prior to 1990 most of the world's debt is denominated in the local currency of the country where the debt was made.  So if I'm an Indian oil refiner and I want to get a loan to build a new plant, I go to a bank and get a loan that I have to pay back in Indian Rupees.  Similarly, if I'm the government of Vietnam and I want to get a loan to build a new highway, I'll go to a bank and get a loan that needs to be paid back in Vietnamese Dong (no they're not cutting people's penises off, that's what the currency there is called).<br />The problem with this is that most of the loans that are being made to countries outside of the US/EU/Japan are being made by the US/EU/Japan.  Countries outside of that area are also incredibly corrupt.  So what happens when the Vietnamese government can't afford to pay back its loan?  It prints a shitload of Dong and uses the freshly printed currency to pay off its debt.  Because of how many Dong have been printed to satisfy this debt, the value of the Dong collapses and the lender is left with a pile of worthless currency.<br />The solution that lenders in the US/EU/Japan came up with for this problem was to make it so that borrowers outside of those regions have to pay back their loans in dollars.  Now it doesn't matter how much the Vietnamese government devalues its currency - it still has to pay back the same amount of dollars.  <br />Most corporate/national debt is made in the form of 20 or 30 year bonds.  In a 20 year bond you make a small interest payment each year.  Then, at the end of the 20 years, you pay back *the entirety of what you were initially loaned*.  <br />So imagine you take a $100 loan, paid back over 20 years with an interest rate of 1%.  Each year you pay the lender $1 (1% of $100).  Then on year 20 you pay $101 (the original $100 value of the loan plus your final interest payment).  That means that to make your debt payment for year 20, you need 101 times as many dollars as you did to make your payment in year 19.<br />Right now all of the early dollar denominated loans to the third world are starting the hit that point where the borrowers need to make that big, final payment.  That's causing a sudden surge in the need for companies and governments to get dollars.  <br />You can view the China Evergrande situation as being a direct result of this.  Evergrande needs to make the final payment on a lot of its 20/30 year bonds right now.  It has physical assets with a sufficient value to do this (it owns a lot of land and buildings).  The problem is it can't hand the buildings to its creditors because of Chinese government restrictions on foreign land ownership.  It needs to sell the buildings to get dollars to pay off its loans.  But it needs so many dollars so quickly that its hard to find people that have that many dollars at once.", "answer_b": "There are a few different factors at play here. First, the US dollar is still considered the global reserve currency, meaning that it is used more than any other currency for international transactions. This means that demand for dollars is always high, even when there is a lot of them in circulation.<br /><br />Second, the trillions of dollars that were printed in the last two years were mostly used to bail out banks and other financial institutions. This money never actually made it into the hands of consumers, so it didn't really increase the overall money supply.<br /><br />Lastly, the global economy is still recovering from the last recession, and many countries are still dealing with high levels of debt.

{"question": "What's the deal with concubines in Ancient China?  How were they selected?  Were any selected from the common classes or were they generally from upper class families?  Was it shameful or a great honor for your daughter or sister to be selected as a concubine?", "answer_a": "In terms of what's the deal, I wrote a bit about [why a monogamous Emperor might not be a practical option](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l5b0m4/were_concubines_mandatory_to_have_in_imperial/gl44xim/) but in short, political ties to important families, increasing chances of children, cosmology to reflect Heaven and good medical practice with balancing yin and yang.<br />The later Han's selection process was that an officer of the imperial household and a eunuch, accompanied by a physiognomist, toured the capital area. They looked for ladies of virtue, beauty and respectable background (no crimes, magic, medicine, trade, handcraft) of between 13-20 sui. Leading families could either present their daughters to the inspectors or make arrangements to skip that, controllers and Dowagers inserting their own candidates (who just happened to be related). Also not unknown for an Emperor in the civil war when Han Empire collapsed  to spot someone they fancied, marriage via conquest, a \"we are sorry we rebelled, have this lady\"<br />In terms of background, the Later Han had background restrictions and any uncertainty, like with the He family who was the first from outside a certain seven families, could lead to rumours. But the Wei dynasty Empresses included a songstress (granted she became Empress after her husband died), an orphan servant (this led to some protest), a carriage maker's daughter (some sneering and protest), one from good background sent as a \"sorry we rebelled\". Policy towards those on the poor families depended on the dynasty, which families they wished to be aligned to, if they wanted to keep a distance from powerful families but there would be people from aristocratic backgrounds.<br />I'm unaware of anybody who felt it was shameful for their relative to enter the imperial harem. An ally inside the imperial palaces wasn't a bad thing,  but an Emperor or controller might not be too keen for someone from the greatest families to have someone inside the harem and potentially getting too powerful or influential.<br />Sources: Fire Over Luoyang by Rafe De Crespigny<br />Empress and Consorts by Robert Cutter and William Cromwell", "answer_b": "A concubine was a woman in ancient China who was sexually available to a man other than her husband.

{"question": "I was wondering if there was any historical references of a Leader employing a humanitarian crisis as a trap for an invading force in the way that the fictional character Marco Inaros succeeded to do on the Expanse?<br />Spoiler for anyone who intends on watching season 6, episode 3 of the Expanse, but I want to find if this was uniquely fictitious or if there’s very real historical events I could also explore. Without needing to see the Expanse, I will give a quick run down of what happened:<br />As two navies fight for control in space, Earth vs the Outer Belt “Free Navy,” the Earth force intends to invade the Capitol city of Ceres station. It was important to establish a foothold in future attacks. Upon arrival, the invaders find that the city has been stripped of all food and supplies, and the residents left with only a few weeks of food before they would starve to death. What appeared to be an effortless victory ended as a humanitarian crisis draining resources and entrapping the Earth navy in a PR nightmare instead of decisive victory. <br />Has this ever been deployed in real life? Maybe in WWII with the prison camps or possibly (and if it’s against the rules to mention, please skip), but modern times fall of Baghdad in the recent war in Iraq be considered a similar ploy?

This created a giant humanitarian crisis that the Union Army was ill-equipped to handle. Their best attempts were to put the freedmen into \"Contraband Camps\" that were rife with disease and unsanitary conditions. Another approach was to lease abandoned and confiscated plantations to Northern factors, who would then employ the freedmen to grow cotton. But in any case the crisis was never completely solved, and it proved to be a constant drain in Union resources and manpower, an embarrassment for the Lincoln administration, and a military factor in that the need to patrol the territory diverted thousands of troops and occasionally had adverse effects in military operations. <br />However, this was not an intentional ploy on the part of the Confederates. If they had gotten their way the Union would never have occupied those territories, and the people they enslaved would have remained in their plantations under their control. The freedmen who remained and thus came under Union protection did so not because of the Confederates but in spite of them, as they refused to flee with their masters. Instead, they abandoned the plantations and entered Union lines, or alternately, knowing that the Union would soon take control of the plantation, remained there, defying attempts to \"refugee\" them. Moreover, most of the outrage in reaction of the terrible conditions in the camps came from Northern abolitionists - people the Southerners despised.", "label": 2}
{"question": "I realize The King’s Man was very much not a historically accurate movie. But there was a trench warfare scene that caught my eye.<br />Essentially Germans and English send scouting parties to no man’s land. The two meet and, using sign language, agree that gunfire will mean the end of all of them. They all put down their firearms and proceed to quietly engage in vicious knife/club fighting. Of course when someone finally breaks down and uses a pistol the trenches on either side erupt with gun fire killing almost all involved parties.<br />Any accuracy to this? Quiet hand-to-hand combat in no man’s land.", "answer_a": "Shortly, yes . Scouting missions into No Man's Land did happen and were undertaken with stealth and little firearms. Melee weapons such as clubs, hatchets, and sharpened entrancing tools were common place weapons and there is even evidence of spears being used in assaults.  German forces, as well as some Allied units, utilized armor for scouting missions as well. <br />In fact, there were entire German squads outfitted with melee weapons and armor that carried out nighttime missions and specialized trench attacks thought the Western Front.

{"question": "What does the term \"metal road/metaled road\" mean and where did it come from? I have frequently seen it in archeology reports, or when Brits are speaking. I presume it to mean an improved road of some sort like gravel or paved road as opposed to a plain dirt road.", "answer_a": "The term \"metal road/metaled road\" is used to describe an improved road surface that is made up of compacted materials like gravel, stone, or pavement. This type of road surface is typically found in areas with high traffic volume or in locations where the natural soil conditions are not suitable for a paved road. In some cases, metal roads can also refer to roads that are coated with a layer of asphalt or other bituminous materials. <br />The term \"metal road\" is believed to have originated in the early 19th century, when roads were first being improved with compacted materials like gravel and stone. At that time, the use of metal (usually iron or steel) was also becoming more common in road construction, as it was used to reinforce the roadbed or to create drainage ditches alongside the road. Over time, the term \"metal road\" came to be used as a general term for any improved road surface, regardless of the materials used. <br />Today, the term \"metal road/metaled road\" is still used in many parts of the world, particularly in Britain, to describe an improved road surface. In some cases, the term is used interchangeably with \"paved road\" or \"tarred road.\" However, in other cases, it may be used to specifically describe a road that is made up of compacted materials like gravel or stone, or a road that is coated with a layer of asphalt or other bituminous material.", "answer_b": "I’m far from an expert, but decided to look this up a bit.

{"question": "Has there been any battles in history where both sides were completely and mutually destroyed?", "answer_a": "In normal conditions, this would not happen, since casualty rates in historical battles are rarely that extreme. In ancient warfare the defeated side might incur something like 10-20% casualties unless things went disastrously wrong. In modern warfare a unit that has lost more than 30% effectives is considered unfit for action.<br />Most of the time, the deciding factor is morale. Warriors simply aren't going to keep on fighting when they see their buddies falling left and right and they see no way of turning things around. They're going to try to get out of there, find a place of safety, and regroup if they can; or they're going to surrender. When the situation is hopeless, most armies will give up the fight, and this will happen long before they come anywhere near total annihilation. In fact, in premodern warfare the great majority of casualties were sustained when the side that broke first was fleeing from the battlefield with the victorious side in hot pursuit.<br />So, given these conditions, what would you need to achieve mutual destruction? You'd need two sides that were roughly evenly matched and utterly determined never to give up. The necessary attitude may sometimes be found among the last defenders of a town or fortress, but of course you would never get two such forces fighting each other; in most cases where one side is prepared to fight to the end, the other side is vastly superior and not similarly inclined. The result would be either the annihilation of the defenders or the flight of the attackers - never mutual destruction.<br />There is one case from Greek history that meets your requirements, though, by virtue of being artificially created and utterly exceptional: the so-called Battle of the Champions, fought around 550 BC between the Spartans and the Argives (Herodotos 1.82). When the two armies met, they agreed to settle their dispute over a border region by each choosing 300 champions, and letting those men fight it out. It seems these picked forces were a match for each other, because all 600 men died, except for two Argives and one Spartan. At that point the two Argives left the battlefield and declared themselves victorious. The Spartan stayed behind, stripped the dead of their armour, and declared himself victorious. <br />There is no other example of a prearranged battle like this in Greek history. The reason is obvious: it was a complete failure, since the two sides couldn't agree on who had won, and in the end they decided to launch their whole armies into an all-out battle anyway. But because of the artificial conditions and the dedication of the 600 champions, it's the closest a battle ever got to complete destruction on both sides.", "answer_b": "There have been a few instances in history where both sides in a battle were completely and mutually destroyed. One example is the Battle of Cannae during the Second Punic War, in which the Carthaginian forces led by Hannibal annihilated a much larger Roman army. Another example is the Battle of Agincourt during the Hundred Years' War, in which the English forces led by Henry V defeated a much larger French army.", "label": 1}

But Jackson wanted a bureaucracy loyal to him, correctly saw that rewarding office seekers with positions was a way to gain political support in their regions, and was quick to terminate people in order to get it. By Lincoln's administration, it was very much expected that a there would be a major turnover in positions coming in with his election, so your story was certainly a joke- a wry one, as Lincoln had plenty of men hanging about the White House getting in his way, hoping for just such a chance.  But the joke had a point, both for Madison and Lincoln- there had to be a quid pro quo, as the office seeker was expected to bring some local influence, bring the support of a Congressman, an electoral district; something useful.

{"question": "When the joint-stock company was first invented, was there a lot of pushback on the concept? What were some of the concerns?  Also any recommended books on the invention of the concept would be much appreciated!", "answer_a": "An early form of joint stock ventures appeared in Assyria by the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE. There does not seem to have been any noticeable pushback against the concept, although trade caravans were often taxed heavily. Of course, the relevant texts were written to and from people engaged in trade, so there's no way of knowing what other Assyrians thought of long distance trade. <br />>Most of these traders had become more independent by having become managers of a \"joint-stock fund\" (called *naruqqum*, \"money bag\"), usually set up in Assur. This phenomenon appeared for the first time around 1900 BC and seems to have been an Old Assyrian invention that went beyond individual partnerships and cooperation in a joint caravan. The arrangement, rather similar to that of the early medieval *compagnia*, meant enlisting a number (usually about a dozen) of investors (*ummiānum*, \"financiers\"), who supplied capital rated in gold, usually in all ca. 30 kilos, ideally consisting of shares of 1 or 2 kilos of gold each. It was entrusted to a trader (the tractator), usually for ca. ten years, for the generally formulated purpose of \"carrying out trade.\" The contract contained stipulations on a final settlement of accounts, on paying dividends, on the division of the expected profit, and on fines for premature withdrawal of capital (meant to secure the duration of the business). Investors or shareholders mostly lived in Assur, but successful traders in Anatolia too invested in funds managed by others, perhaps also as a way of sharing commercial risks. In such cases a contract would to be drawn up in Anatolia that obliged the tractator \"to book in Assur x gold in his joint stock fund in the investor's name.\" Among the investors we find members of the tractator's family, but also business relations and others, probably a kind of \"merchant-bankers,\" and other rich citizens, who aimed at fairly safe, long-term investments.<br />[\"Ancient Assur: The City, its Traders, and its Commercial Network\"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25651212) by Klaas Veenhof<br />For more on Old Assyrian trade and these early joint stock funds, see [*Ancient Kanesh: A Merchant Colony in Bronze Age Anatolia*](https://books.google.com/books?id=qXGgCgAAQBAJ) by Mogens Larsen.", "answer_b": "There was definitely some pushback when the joint-stock company was first invented.

{"question": "What were the differences (if any) in the standard protective finishes on firearms from WWI to WWII?<br />I'm struggling to find conclusive details on the protective finishes used on historical firearms.<br />While browning has been around for centuries, blueing seems to be almost universally preferred for firearms. However, I can't find any reliable sources on exactly how these firearms were protected. Some say they were blued, others that they just slapped on a load of radiator paint. Still others talk about anodising but that seems unlikely to me based on examples I've seen. I've also heard that they simply weren't protected at all, notably with the Sten gun.", "answer_a": "As you likely have noticed, there are LOTS of ways to blue a firearm. What makes it confusing is that both browning and blueing are making an iron oxide layer, and a blued finish will, on exposure to the elements ( like, someone goes hunting) bit by bit revert to regular brown rust, so quite a lot of guns are now brown that were once blue ( there's a gunsmith invocation over blueing: \"from rust you came, to rust you shall return\"). <br />In the later 1800's it was discovered that a phosphate coating could be created that was more stable than blueing or browning. The patent history is a bit complex, but the process was made practical after 1900, and in 1918 the Parker Rust-Proof Company started up in Detroit. Because of them , the finish has since generally been called parkerizing, and it was adopted by Springfield Armory and contractors as the standard finish on US small arms in WWII, like the Garand, the 1911A1 automatic pistol, the 1903A3 rifle.  I'm afraid I don't know if any other countries used it, however: I think a blued finish was the most common elsewhere. <br />Even though the patents have long expired, the Parker Company still exists, and has a [website](https://www.parkerhq.com/about-us)<br />Angier, R.

{"question": "I have read on this subreddit before that it was not unheard of for medieval nuns writing about Jesus and God in very erotic, or seemingly erotic, terms. I was wondering if there is any compiled lists of this medieval thirst poetry or what are some more famous examples of it?", "answer_a": "Yes, this was absolutely a thing – and a reasonably widespread thing at that. Quite a lot of medieval religious women practiced aversion of mystical theology which incorporated a significant erotic element. This tended to revolve around casting Jesus as a bridegroom figure, with whomthe mystic envisioned themselves achieving spiritual, mystical union with. It’s worth noting that it was by no means only women practicing this kind of spiritual experience. Indeed, one of the most prominent examples of this practice is St Bernard of Clairvaux’s (1090-1153) sermons on the Song of Songs, in which he makes use of strongly sexualised imagery to describe union with Christ (and then promptly chastises his audience for their dirty minds – good consistentapproach there Bernard, A+).<br />However, it’s certainly the women who are the most famous for this practice, and it does seem to have been a largely female (andcertainly feminised) form of mysticism. To the best of my knowledge, there’s not a compiled list, simply because there’s a huge amount of the stuff. Poetry is prominent, but there’s also many prose accounts of mystical visions and experiences. There is an (important) caveat that the actual writer of these experiences can differ – in some cases it is the mystic herself, but in many other it’s a male (usually mendicant) confessor or spiritual director. This can be a very significant filter on the voice that we can access, and can play a part in homogenising or “flattening” the texts.<br />In terms of the content, “thirst poetry” is an interesting modern analogy, but it’s important to remember that the erotic content of works like this is (at least theoretically) very much the means to the end, which is complete and total union with the divine. Much mystical theology works in an apophatic way – this means that God is conceptualised as the ultimate negative, completely unknown and unknowable. Due to this fundamentally unreachable nature, a variety of intellectual strategies are employed to try and bridge this epistemological gap, of which the use of the erotic mode of expression is just one. It’s also worth noting that one could quite equally look at some of this “erotic” language and categorise it as being about violent behaviour instead. See for example Beatrice of Nazareth’s description of love:<br />*“Meantime, when love acts in the heart so vehemently and riotously, it becomes so excessive and exuberant in the soul that the soul thinks its heart has been wounded in many and grave ways.... So it seems that its veins are opened and its blood is boiling out, its marrow is withered and its legs are weak, its chest burns and its throat is dry.... And the soul thus feels love acting riotously within it, sparing nothing, uncontrollably seizing and consuming everything within the soul like a devouring fire…”*<br />Or Mechthild of Magdeburg’s description of the union with the Godhead:<br />*“She is captured in the first experience*  <br />*When God kisses her in sweet union.*  <br />*She is assailed with many a holy thought*  <br />*That she not waver when she mortifies her flesh.*  <br />*She is bound by the power of the Holy Spirit,*  <br />*And her bliss is indeed manifold.*  <br />*She is slapped with the great powerlessness*  <br />*Of not being able to enjoy without interruption eternal light”*<br />I’m not saying these works are *about* violence specifically, just that they’re not either uncomplicatedly erotic, or using eroticism as the primary meaning of the text.<br />Famous examples – probably the most widely known these days are Margery Kempe (experiencing something of a renaissance recently) and St Catherine of Siena. Examples do, however, multiply - Dorothea of Montau, Marguerite Porete, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch of Antwerp – the list goes on. I’d suggest that Kempe and St Catherine are probably the easiest to find editions of the complete text, though I’d not swear to that.<br />If you want some good reading on the subject, a classic text is C. Walker-Bynum, *Fragmentation and Redemption* (New York: Zone Books, 1992). A broader (and possibly more accessible) work is E. A.

A lot of times the chemicals are just destructive to tissue. Imagine you get sprayed in the face by a water hose. Some of that water's going to go in your mouth and up your nose. Now imagine instead of water, it's a toxin that destroys cell tissue. The hose stops, you gasp for breath, and your lungs start scarring as the vapor dissolves them. Or it could be a neurotoxin that disrupts your nerves so effectively the signals for your heart to beat stop working.

Follow up question; Does it not get affected or dissolve in our stomach?", "answer_a": "The chemical reactions in your body are set and unchanging. It is impossible to introduce new chemical pathways. All pharmacology is either enhancing or suppressing one of these pathways. Drug side effects occur when the drug is chemically similar enough to interact with something in a different pathway other the one it is intended to work on. all the chemical pathways are interconnected as well so slowing one down or speeding one up is likely to have a “domino” effect which causes other effects to occur. Furthermore the same chemicals can serve multiple roles depending on the tissue they are present in, taking an analogue of that chemical systemically may cause multiple different effects in different tissues.  [map of the biochemical pathways in your body](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/bio_sim/articles/metabolic_pathways.png)", "answer_b": "Usually side effects happen because the medications do more in the body than just treat the initial problem. This is because often the medications are made to be processed by the body (ingested a certain way, digested/flow into the bloodstream etc) without causing any problems within the body which cause serious issues but enough for the body to utilise the medication to treat the needs it is created for. This also means that often a medication may treat multiple areas which are not needed by the body for treatment thus to not cause harm must be at a certain dosage, or vice versa. They “under treat” an issue due to the medication being needed for multiple uses/not being able to directly fix the problem at hand alone. This is where side effects come in, normally they are not too bad depending upon the issue but if you are having issues then please speak with your personal health professional. It is also possible to have positive side effects, and In theory this has caused medications to be used for medical treatments wider than their initial intended use, often modified to treat a different issue. But basically the medication cannot directly pin point where the target area may be needed to work so in effect, treats the whole body with such intake - thus causing unrelated bodily side effects elsewhere as it is absorbed as a whole and processed through the entire system, interacting with any and all other molecules it comes into contact with.", "label": 1}

That is why you can't label food as \"no MSG\" or \"MSG free\", it's always \"no MSG added\" because if it has protein at all then it's going to have MSG. MSG, like sodium, is really one of those things that is associated with living things, and it is healthy to have it in your diet. Like sodium, there is such thing as too much. With all that said, there are studies that have shown negative effects of extreme amounts of glutamate (but nobody eats that much), and lots have shown negative effects of MSG, but the MSG negative effects can mostly be explained as too much sodium. As it relates to Chinese food, they traditionally use a lot of soy sauce, which is really soy protein and salt in liquid form, it forms a LOT of MSG, to the point that soy sauce can be considered liquid MSG. Using a lot of soy sauce will add a lot of sodium to your diet, and yes, Chinese food tends to be high in sodium. Those negative effects of Chinese food are really too much sodium, I have gotten headaches from Chinese food, it absolutely was too much sodium.

{"question": "Why are engine exhuast valves so much smaller than intake valves? I get that the fuel burns but obviously there is no loss of mass or number of atoms. There is energy released and an increase in pressure, but if anything this would mean the exhuast valves should be bigger to handle the post combustion increase in pressure.", "answer_a": "When you suck in air through a small opening, there's an upper limit to the pressure difference. You've got one atmosphere of pressure (1 bar) on one side and you can't have more than a perfect vacuum on the other side. 'Sucking harder' won't help and you're limited to 1 bar. When you blow air through a small opening, there's no real upper limit to the pressure difference. In that case 'blowing harder' does help and you can have a pressure difference of 2 or 3 bar. That's why pushing air through the exhaust valves is less of a challenge than sucking air through the intakes valves, and you can trade a bit of exhaust valve area for more intake valve area to improve overall airflow.", "answer_b": "There is quite clearly an increase in the number of atoms with combustion.  Long chain hydrocarbons are converted mainly to water and carbon dioxide.  But this has nothing to do with the size of the valves. When the exhaust valves open at the end of the combustion stroke, the pressure in the cylinder is high because of the high temperature (causes gases to want to expand), and thus the flow rate out of the exhaust valves will be high.  Said another way, there is a big pressure differential or difference between the pressure in the cylinder and the pressure in the exhaust manifold during the exhaust stroke.  So the exhaust goes out fast.  Like air from a balloon that you are squeezing really hard.  You don't need a big valve for that to get a good flow rate and fully evacuate the cylinder of the exhaust gases.  For the intake stroke, the pressure difference between the cylinder and the intake manifold is small, so the flow rate will be lower.  You need a bigger valve to get all the air into the cylinder by the end of the intake stroke.  This is especially true at high rpm.", "label": 2}

You can define units so it is 1. The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant", "answer_b": "Gases exhibit some proportional relationships:  - V ~ n: twice the amount of particles will take up twice the volume. - V ~ T: at twice the absolute temperature (measured in Kelvin), the gas takes up twice the volume. - V ~ 1/p: at twice the pressure, the gas will take up half the volume. We can combine these three relationships into V ~ nT/p. So if we know the volume of a given quantity of gas at a given pressure and temperature, we can calculate how it changes when we change any of these properties. The gas constant gives us a base number for that relationship: in the form you stated it, it is the volume of one mol of (ideal) gas at a pressure of 1 atmosphere and a temperature of 1 Kelvin. From this, you can then calculate the volume of *any* amount of ideal gas at *any* pressure and *any* temperature.", "label": 2}

The primary being chemical and secondary being physical. Physical is a whole other subject as it deals with low level interactions of molecules (IE Gecko Tape). The one most people are familiar with is chemical and is why tape has that very distinct \"tack\" when you touch it.  The tack forms due to a reaction between the glue on the tape and the surface of whatever your trying to stick it too. When a roll of tape is rolled up, the backside has been given great care to ensure its cleaned and may sometimes be coated in a way that slows down the reaction of the glue.  While this has allowed the creation of very powerful adhesives there is many downsides to making tape that adheres stuff chemically. One of the main ones being that once the reactants in the glue have been used up, the tape is nothing more than the backing that was holding the glue in the first place. Tape is considered to have a shelf life for this very reason as common things that drive chemical reactions such as oxygen, heat, and time will cause parts of the tape to break down. This results in the tape prematurely adhering to the backing, the tack being less effective and why that edge on the tape can be hard to find.

{"question": "What makes diamond so hard ? Please, demystify this for me.", "answer_a": "Diamonds are hard because of their tight, interlocked atomic structure. Pure diamond is made up of carbon atoms only. Each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms tetrahedrally, with four sides. The carbon atoms are close together, forming a dense crystal. That structure can be repeated indefinitely, with strong bonds in four directions. Contrast this with graphite, which is also formed from carbon atoms. But in graphite the carbon is formed into layers, with weak forces between layers. This makes graphite soft and slippery, the opposite of diamonds. So it’s not the carbon that makes diamonds hard, but the tight multi-directional bonding between carbon atoms.  That bonding is created by perfectly balanced extreme heat and pressure over millions of years far underground. Geological events like volcanic eruptions then bring the diamonds to the Earth’s surface to be mined. Many diamonds have imperfections or flaws that weaken the structure. But the best are almost perfect crystals, with geometrically regular forms starting at the atomic level.  Humans have learned how to create artificial diamonds in labs. Lab-grown diamonds are chemically and physically no different from natural diamonds. Nearly all industrial grade diamonds are lab-grown.  Gem quality diamonds can also be produced in the lab, and to the naked eye there is no difference from natural diamonds. It takes special instruments to tell the difference. In fact, the way the instruments tell the difference is that artificial diamonds are too perfect, lacking the traces of nitrogen found in natural diamonds.

{"question": "How is iron black, yet steel light grey? ", "answer_a": "Grey cast iron is almost black on the outside because of the slag (surface impurities) that cling when they are cast. When you machine it, it is a dark grey.    There is also white cast iron, where iron and carbon form iron carbides, which give is a whitish colour.   Steel can be dark grey to silvery, depending on what is alloyed into it. High Speed Steel is silvery when surface machined, but when it breaks (it is quite brittle) it is also dark grey.", "answer_b": "Iron and typical iron alloys like steel and cast iron are silvery grey.  Higher carbon alloys like cast iron tend to be lighter coloured than those without much carbon like wrought iron with steel being in the middle. However, iron and its alloys react with oxygen to form  rust.  Iron gets bigger when it becomes rust, which causes the rust to flake off exposing more iron to oxygen so it can rust.  Obviously, we don't want this to happen. We solve this problem by coating it with some sort of protection. Stainless steel contains additives that oxidizes to form a thin, transparent layer of protection. In other cases we coat the iron in a layer of paint or oil.  This is why swords and fancy kitchen knives need to be oiled. We also coat iron with other metals that are more corrosion resistant like zinc, chromium, or nickle. When iron is hot, it it oxidizes more rapidly, but instead of rust it forms hematite which is bluish-black and doesn't flake like rust does.  This can serve as a protective layer against oxidation that causes rust.  The hematite is somewhat fragile so it is normally protected with a layer of oil.  This is known as \"bluing\", particularly when done to firearms, and \"seasoning\" a pan is similar except that the oil is heated to smoke point which causes it to harden into a sort of plastic.

{"question": "Why do you have to eat sliced deli meat in 7 days but it can sit in the glass counter for who knows how long? ", "answer_a": "It doesn't. The store only unwraps each loaf as it is needed. And only carries products it knows it will turn over.  In a busy store several loaves of popular meats will be used each day. They are used up much more quickly than the slices you take home.", "answer_b": "Sliced deli meats are typically high in sodium and other preservatives, which allow them to have a long shelf life. However, these preservatives can also make the meat less healthy for you if you consume too much of them. For this reason, it is generally recommended that you eat sliced deli meat within 7 days of buying it.", "label": 2}
{"question": "Why do water molecules attract each other (why does cohesion happen) if they're stable/have a neutral charge? H2O is stable/has a neutral chrage, right? Why do they attract each other if they're stable?", "answer_a": "Water molecules attract each other because they are polar molecules. This means that they have a slightly positive charge on one side and a slightly negative charge on the other. This gives them a tendency to stick together, which is called cohesion.", "answer_b": "They are neutral overall but the charge  isn't balanced out everywhere in the molecule. The oxygen nucleus has eight protons and the hydrogens  only one each. So the oxygen pulls more strongly on the electron cloud, attracting more than it's fair share. As a result the oxygen has a small negative excess charge (more electrons near it on average) and the electron-deficient hydrogens a small positive one. Opposites attract so a hydrogen of one molecule is pulled by an oxygen of another resulting in strong intermolecular forces, a high surface tension and a much higher boiling point than the molecular weight would suggest.", "label": 2}
{"question": "does boiling water work as efficiently to put out a fire as cold water or even room temp water? Or does the molecular structure change in a certain way once heated, and in turn can steam put out a fire.", "answer_a": "To answer your second question, steam is great for putting out fires. A small amount of water will turn into a great deal of steam, which removes one of the four things a fire needs (heat, fuel, oxygen, and the chemical reaction). Firefighters routinely use short bursts of water to create steam to knock down a fire. Firefighters are careful, though, because making too much steam tends to hurt humans - steam goes through bunker gear.", "answer_b": "Despite what others say it would obviously qork a little worse but still work. Its still cutting off oxygen, and sure its taking some heat away but for the most part boiling water is only taking out one leg of fire triangle rather than two. (Heat, Fuel, Oxygen)", "label": 1}
{"question": "why do some liquids turn into solid when heated? In school we learn that things go from liquid to gas when they reach certain temperature. But things like eggs and other things we cook actually go from liquid to solid. Why/how?", "answer_a": "Some liquids turn into solid when heated because of a process called phase transition. A phase transition is a change in the physical state of a substance. For example, water can exist in three different states: solid (ice), liquid, and gas (vapor). The phase transition from liquid to solid is called freezing, and the phase transition from solid to liquid is called melting.   Some substances can exist in more than one solid state. For example, carbon can exist as two different solids: graphite and diamond. The phase transition from one solid state to the other is called polymorphism.   Polymorphism is a type of phase transition in which a substance changes from one solid state to another. The two solid states have different arrangements of atoms. The atoms in the two different solid states are held together by different kinds of forces.   The phase transition from liquid to solid is called freezing. The temperature at which a liquid freezes is called the freezing point. The freezing point is the temperature at which the molecules of a substance have enough energy to overcome the forces that are holding them together in the liquid state.   The freezing point of a substance depends on the kind of forces that are holding the molecules together. For example, the freezing point of water is lower than the freezing point of alcohol. This is because the forces that are holding the molecules of water together are weaker than the forces that are holding the molecules of alcohol together.   The phase transition from solid to liquid is called melting. The temperature at which a solid melts is called the melting point. The melting point is the temperature at which the molecules of a substance have enough energy to overcome the forces that are holding them together in the solid state.   The melting point of a substance also depends on the kind of forces that are holding the molecules together. For example, the melting point of diamond is much higher than the melting point of graphite. This is because the forces that are holding the molecules of diamond together are much stronger than the forces that are holding the molecules of graphite together.", "answer_b": "The answers already given are good, but I think the point where you may be getting confused is that vaporization and melting points (the point where a liquid goes to a gas, or a solid goes to a liquid respectively) only apply to pure substances, though they do generally go cooler = solid and hotter = gas with liquid in between. Eggs are not a pure substance, because as mentioned already they are water plus protein plus salts plus fats etc. which all react a little differently to being heated. A visual representation of a substance’s phase changes (liquid/solid/gas) and the energy required to achieve them is called a phase diagram. It is technically possible to create one for a mixture of multiple different types of molecule, but the concentrations are necessary so you would have to know a lot about that egg to construct one.", "label": 2}
{"question": "Why do bugs love the underside of rocks or fallen logs anyway?<br />is it the humidity? the darkness? also why?", "answer_a": "It's to hide from predators, birds and rodents especially.

{"question": "Why aren't identical twins half the size of single humans?<br />If identical twins are created when a single fertilized egg splits on half during development, why do those two halves form into normal humans? Wouldn't they only have half of the normal mass/size of a single-child pregnancy? I mean, if a fertilized egg splits and the two fragments can form into two normal sized humans, wouldn't that mean if the egg never split, the single human would have the mass/size of the two twins combined? Does the cell somehow know that it split, and somehow it then knows that despite losing half of what it already had as a single egg, it needs to develop as if it never had the material from the portion that split off? Sorry if this sounds like rambling, but I can't find any information on this topic online.", "answer_a": "The egg does not contain all the material of the final human being. Eggs are large by cell standards - they're about the size of the period at the end of this sentence if you're using a typical monitor - but they're much smaller than a fetus or newborn child.<br />And in fact, the fertilized egg *doesn't* typically split in half with identical twins. Instead, identical twins diverge a little later in development (a few days in) during the split between the cells that form the placenta and the cells that form what will eventually be the final human. A single layer of cells (called the *trophoblast*) forms the placenta, and inside that is a blob of cells (the \"inner cell mass\") that forms the embryo. In identical twins, *two* inner cell masses form instead of one. But at this point the placenta attaches to and begins receiving nutrients from the uterine wall.<br />So while the two embyros begin slightly smaller than they otherwise would, they have access to outside nutrients very early in development, and it's those outside nutrients that enable actual growth in size.", "answer_b": "> Does the cell somehow know that it split, and somehow it then knows that despite losing half of what it already had as a single egg, it needs to develop as if it never had the material from the portion that split off? <br />Essentially, yes.  Identical twinning is a genetically transmitted characteristic, so the initial cell would \"know\" that it was going to twin, and would have to go through one extra division.", "label": 1}
{"question": "How are deep sea animals not more resilient at the surface?<br />This might sound like a dumb question but I promise I'm serious. I was watching a video on the depth of the ocean and it got me curious how deep sea creatures don't immediately squash under all that pressure. I did some reading on it and from what I saw, fish/squid/etc lack swim bladders and as a result lack anything left in their bodies to be compressed. Yet I'm still a bit confused on how these animals even open their mouths under all that weight.. how they have an open stomach. Wouldn't that be flattened as well? The only thing I could think of is that the pressure inside their bodies maybe equalize the pressure on the outside.<br />Which brings me the to the last part of the question. As a part of that video, I saw that a leatherback sea turtle has a maximum diving depth of 1,280 meters. Yet just before that it mentioned that the pressure that far down is roughly equivalent to a polar bear standing on a postage stamp. I can kind of overlook how fish do it, but I can't really imagine a polar bear standing on a sea turtle's face and it be just fine. I can't even imagine me being able to punch a sea turtle in the face and it being fine. Yet apparently it's somehow invincible.", "answer_a": "Fill a baloon with water. Immerse it in water. What do you think the water is going to do with it?<br />Of course it's squishy, especially outside water, but it's not like water can somehow compress other water which is what's mostly inside most creatures.", "answer_b": "There are a few reasons why deep sea animals are not more resilient at the surface. One reason is that they lack swim bladders, which helps them to float. Without this, they would sink to the bottom of the ocean and be crushed by the pressure. Another reason is that they have a higher density than surface animals, which makes it harder for them to float. Finally, deep sea animals have adapted to the high pressure and cold temperatures of the deep ocean, and would not be able to survive in the warmer, shallower waters of the surface.", "label": 2}

Their main job is to protect and moisturise the eyes, not prevent you seeing things, that's just a useful bonus. After all, we evolved in a world where there was very little artificial light. At night, it would be pitch black - there'd be no extra light for your eyes to block as you're trying to sleep anyway. If you pay attention next time you close your eyes in a bright environment, you'll notice that what you're seeing isn't black, it's a red glow.

{"question": "Why do people go bald on the top of their head and still have some on the sides and not vice-versa?<br />", "answer_a": "There are a few reasons why people go bald on the top of their head and still have some hair on the sides. One reason is that the hair follicles on the top of the head are more sensitive to a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a byproduct of testosterone and is found in both men and women. When DHT levels are high, it can cause the hair follicles on the top of the head to miniaturize, which leads to hair loss. Another reason is that the hair on the sides and back of the head is not as exposed to the sun and other environmental factors, which can damage the hair and lead to hair loss.", "answer_b": "Seems unsettled but here’s a theory:<br />“The most recent hypothesis suggests that the hair loss process begins during puberty, when growth of the skull and the muscles in the forehead and neck increases the tension in a tight band of tissue stretching over the top of the head. The more DHT (a type of testosterone) there is, the more these muscles contract, which causes inflammation and brings in more DHT. Over time, the DHT thickens the band of tissue, restricting the supply of blood and nutrients to the hair follicles above it. The follicles on top of the head get smaller and eventually disappear, while those on the sides of the head remain largely unaffected.”<br />Source<br />https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-do-men-go-bald-from-the-top-of-their-heads/", "label": 2}

{"question": "If under anesthesia do you get your sleep needed for the day?<br />", "answer_a": "No. The unconsciousness induced by both IV anesthetics and inhaled anesthetics is very different from restorative sleep. In fact, patients in ICUs who are sedated for long periods of time with some of the same medications they use in anesthesia get delirium from both a lack of sleep and a lack of proper awake time. <br />This is also true for prescription benzodiazepines like Ativan (lorazepam) and Xanax (alprazolam) which are often prescribed for insomnia but do not produce true sleep. <br />There is an IV sedative called Dexmedetomodine (precedex) that produces an unconsciousness more similar to sleep and has been shown to reduce the risk of ICU delirium vs more common medications like propofol. It is also used as an adjunct in anesthetic practice. But it is not nearly as prominent as propofol or inhaled anesthetics for a few reasons. First, it takes longer to work so after a dose you have to wait 15-30min for it to take effect (propofol is within a minute or so) and it lasts longer once it is stopped. Additionally, up until recently it was on patent and quite expensive. The patent recently expired and it is seeing increased use but I doubt it will ever become as popular as propofol.  <br />EDIT: Precedex also isn't a full anesthetic in standard practice so for surgery under general anesthesia it still needs to be used with another medicine like propofol or anesthesia gas.

Evans claimed to have initially panicked, hid the body in a nearby sewer, gave his daughter to relatives, and tried to flee the country, but then, overcame with guilt, has turned himself in.<br />Police arrived in the sewer where Evans claimed to have hidden the body and not only didn't find any but realized a single man could not open the hatch to get down, as it took two officers to lift. Pressed Evans admitted to omitting the truth - he wasn't the one who gave his wife the medicine, it was his downstairs neighbour, John Christie. Christia informed Evans of the tragedy and convinced him it would be better if he disappeared for some time so no one connects him to his wife's death. Christie said he will hid the body in the sewers and make his relatives take care of Evans' daughter. Evans was covering him out of gratitude, understanding his wife's death was an accident.<br />Christie denied everything and suggested Evans may have hidden the body in the small garden adjacent to their apartment complex - he has found a part of it where it seems someone uprooted the earth. Quickly digging the cops found bodies of Evans' wife and daughter, both strangled.<br />Pressed again Evans signed a testimony admitting to having murdered his wife and child but later claimed he was forced to do it under threats of violence. In the court, he tried to accuse Christie but as someone who already has changed his testimony multiple times and had a shady past, his word could not stand to the word of respected former police officer Christie was. Evans was found guilty and executed in March of 1950.<br />In 1953 Christie moved out of his apartment. The new tenant immediately began renovating the place. And behind wallpaper in the kitchen found the bodies of three women. After informing the police someone looked into Evans' case and realized they never searched the whole garden, despite reports of dogs finding human bones in it. They never bothered to ask how Evans accessed a garden only Christie had the key to. They never looked into reports of Christie's violent behavior, including an assault on a woman. Digging through the garden revealed more bodies, from before and after Evans' case. Christie was apprehended and among his possessions was a newspaper clip of Evans being found guilty, as if it was something he was proud of.<br />John Christie was put on trial and found guilty of the murder of at least 8 women but the story doesn't end there. His sentencing made people question whenever Evans was not innocent and just framed by Christie. At the time government of Britain was very supportive of the death penalty and argued there is no way such a sentence would be accidentally performed on an innocent person. To avoid losing face the government called not one but two committees that both tried to claim they believe Evans was indeed guilty. Of course, it was a lie as no one would believe two people were living next to each other, killing the same type of victims at the same time and hiding them in the same spot and somehow did not notice each other. Meaning that defending the death penalty caused the spread of corruption among government officials of all levels. the case made a mockery of justice and is seen as one of the reasons why Great Britain abolished the death penalty.", "label": 2}

Sometimes, like in a mathematical proof, we want something that absolutely is correct if our premises are correct. <br />Since we can never say \"This Authority is absolutely correct about all their assertions\", then trying to claim such is a logical fallacy. <br />However, on a more practical heuristic level where absolute certainty isn't the goal but a reasonable guess at what's probably right is, then citing an authority is a reasonable guideline if you think the methods for declaring someone an authority were justified. For instance, if a great majority of the doctors in your country are well-trained, and they think epidemiologists are the best at knowing how to handle disease outbreaks, and they think that, say, Anthony Fauci is the best viral epidemiologist out there, then it might be reasonable to accept his advice on the subject as persuasive.", "label": 2}

From when does a human need to abide the law, who've set the first laws, who decided that every human needs to respect it? so many questions, so few answers", "answer_a": "Laws are enforced by the government and police force. In the past, laws would have been enforced formally or informally by other members of your community.<br />If I get together with a bunch of people, we could all decide that stealing is wrong. We could then agree on a punishment for stealing. If someone tries to steal, the rest of the society would band together to enforce this punishment. I'm incentivized to not steal because the consequences of stealing are worse than the benefits I'd gain.", "answer_b": "There are a number of reasons why we need to abide by the law. First and foremost, the law is designed to protect our society and our individual rights. Without laws, there would be chaos and anarchy. The law provides a framework for us to live our lives in a safe and orderly manner.<br /><br />In addition, the law is a way of ensuring that everyone is treated fairly and equally. The law sets out clear rules and guidelines that everyone must follow. This helps to prevent discrimination and unfair treatment.<br /><br />Finally, obeying the law is a way of showing respect for the government and the legal system.

{"question": "What's the difference between decriminalization and legalization? ", "answer_a": "Decriminalization is the process of removing criminal penalties for a particular activity, while legalization is the process of making that activity legal. For example, decriminalization of marijuana would mean that possessing small amounts of the drug would no longer be a criminal offense, while legalization would mean that marijuana would be regulated and taxed like any other product.", "answer_b": "In practise, the difference is that you won't be arrested for the offence along (eg possession of decriminalised drugs) but if you're being arrested for something else, like assault/robbery etc they'll charge you with possession as part of that arrest.

{"question": "What is a filibuster? I keep hearing about it but I truly don’t understand what it means and why it’s such a big deal?", "answer_a": "A filibuster is a parliamentary procedure where debate on a bill is extended, essentially preventing a vote from taking place. This can be done by any senator, and in the past, it was used as a way to stall civil rights legislation. Nowadays, it's often used as a tactic to delay or prevent a vote on a bill, or to force the Senate to reach a 60-vote supermajority.", "answer_b": "Originally, senators debated bills or confirmations. A senator can speak as long as he wants in this debate, and in the past they spoke for days to delay a bill, even reading from a phone book to pass the time. That's a filibuster. The rest of the Senate can shut him up with 60 votes to allow debate to continue (cloture). The Senate could only consider one bill at a time, so this held up the entire work of the Senate, even stopped the people of the same party from getting their bills heard. Filibusters were very politically expensive and individually exhausting, so they didn't happen much. <br />Over the years this has evolved. Back in the 1970s the Democrats allowed two legislative tracks, making it less politically expensive. The number of filibusters shot up after that. It eventually involved into not having to actually speak, and now any senator can stall a bill simply by saying so. Filibusters are now politically cheap, so they happen all the time, any bill or confirmation that is in any way contentious.", "label": 1}

{"question": "Why criminals need to throwing away the guns after committing a serious crime ", "answer_a": "The act of disposing of a weapon can be an attempt to distance oneself from a crime.  If the police see that someone was killed with a specific type of handgun, and then through their investigation, they discover that you have that handgun in your possession, it's a huge help towards solving the crime and prosecuting the criminal.  Disposing of the weapon could provide a means of deniability if the weapon is found, for example a criminal may say \"Oh someone stole that gun from me a month ago and I haven't seen it since.\"  Plausible defense if the gun is found in a lakebed, not so much if it's found in your sock drawer.", "answer_b": "There are a few reasons why criminals might choose to get rid of their guns after committing a serious crime. One reason is that it could help them avoid getting caught by the police. If the police find the gun at the crime scene, they could use it to trace the gun back to the owner and then to the criminal.

{"question": "Prison sentences that go way beyond an average lifespan. I'm talking 100-1000 year sentence ", "answer_a": "Several reasons<br />It sends a signal as to how severe the crime is. The justice system is telling us that this person did stuff bad enough to be incarcerated for more than the rest of their life.<br />It helps the victims and survivors to see that the crime against them has been recognized. If you have a single \"life\" sentence for someone that killed four people, the families of those four people are just seeing it as a single crime. However, 25 years for each adding to a hundred years in total acknowledges them as four individual crimes. There's perhaps a little more comfort in that, and a sense of justice served.<br />And it helps make more informed decisions about the possibility of parole or clemency in the future. Dude got a life sentence? Maybe 20 years served is enough. Dude got a 1000 year sentence? They ain't EVER getting out.", "answer_b": "This is mostly an issue in states where prison sentences can stack upon each other. 5 years for three robberies make 15 years in total. This is not done in many states as far as I am aware. <br />E.g. most states in the european union take all charges known into a single court trial and get a prison sentence out covering all charges into one. <br />Also many european countries have a max-lifetime sentence which cannot be extend under normal circumstances. E.g. in germany its 15 years IIRC. Which is a fairly significant span of your life.<br />Because longer prison sentences do not stop crime in large, nor do they help with the reintegration of criminals into society.

And if you forged a lease agreement, like so many do, you'll be going to federal prison. *That's the bad one where dropping the soap is a thing.*", "answer_b": "Adverse possession is a legal doctrine that allows a person to gain ownership of a piece of property through continuous, exclusive, and uninterrupted use. In order to successfully claim adverse possession, the squatting individual must meet certain requirements set forth by state law, which vary from state to state. Generally speaking, the squatter must have been using the property for a certain period of time (usually 5-20 years), in a way that is open and notorious (meaning that the owner is aware of the squatter's use of the property), and with the intent to possess the property (meaning that the squatter must have the intention of using the property as their own). If these requirements are met, the squatter may be able to gain legal ownership of the property.<br /><br />There are a few exceptions to the rule of adverse possession. For example, if the property is owned by the government or if the squatter is a tenant of the property owner, the squatter will not be able to claim adverse possession. Additionally, some states have laws that specifically prohibit adverse possession (meaning that even if the requirements are met, the squatter will not be able to gain ownership of the property).<br /><br />So, in answer to your question, yes, it is possible for a squatter to gain legal ownership of a piece of property through adverse possession.

Usually when you hear these scary stories about “innocent guy loses 500k case to his burglar” there’s a lot more to the story than what you’re being told. The McDonalds coffee suit is a perfect example because it wasn’t ridiculous at all but gets portrayed that way (wonder who’s behind that?), the coffee was heated to a degree that would never be safe to serve to a customer and resulted in very serious burns yet it often gets twisted as “look how ridiculous people are, they’ll sue even over coffee that’s a little too warm”.", "label": 2}
{"question": "How can the Texas House Speaker ban the word “racism” from being used in a legislative session? Can he restrict the free speech of Texas’ House Members? Is this legal?", "answer_a": "The Texas House Speaker can ban the word \"racism\" from being used in a legislative session by issuing a formal directive to House Members. This directive could state that the use of the word \"racism\" is prohibited in any official capacity during the session. House Members would then be required to adhere to this directive or face consequences, such as being removed from the session or being censured.<br /><br />The Speaker's ability to restrict the free speech of House Members is derived from the House's rules of order. These rules give the Speaker significant authority to regulate the conduct of Members and to enforce decorum in the chamber. While the Speaker's authority is not absolute, it is generally upheld by the House as long as the Speaker is acting in good faith and in the interest of maintaining order.<br /><br />The legality of the Speaker's actions would likely be challenged on the grounds that they violate the First Amendment right to free speech. However, the Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment does not protect all forms of speech, and that the government can place reasonable restrictions on speech in certain circumstances. It is possible that a court would find that the Speaker's actions are permissible under the First Amendment, although this is by no means certain.", "answer_b": "Technically the floor of a congress is NOT a place with full freedom of speech.

{"question": "What is “age of consent” Just saw an advice post about a 16 y/o worried about dating an 18 y/o boy she likes. Seems like that’d be the definition of “consent”, yet many people in the thread were concerned about legality.", "answer_a": "In the context of relationships and dating, the age of consent refers to the minimum age at which one person is legally allowed to engage in sexual activity with another person. In most jurisdictions, the age of consent is 16 years old, which means that anyone under the age of 16 is not legally allowed to consent to sexual activity. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule, such as if the two people areClose in age (e.g. within 3 years of each other) or if they are married.<br /><br />In the case of the 16 year old girl and the 18 year old boy, the age of consent would be 18 years old. This means that the 16 year old girl is not legally allowed to consent to sexual activity with the 18 year old boy. However, as long as the 18 year old boy is not more than 3 years older than the 16 year old girl, the two of them can still date and engage in sexual activity without breaking any laws.", "answer_b": "The age of consent is a legal term for the minimum age in which a person can consent to sexual activity.

{"question": "why cant america just ban guns feels like it would solve alot of problems", "answer_a": "There are a number of reasons why America cannot simply ban guns. First, there is the issue of the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to keep and bear arms. This right has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to apply to individuals, and not just to militias. As a result, any attempt to ban guns would likely be unconstitutional.<br /><br />Second, there is the issue of enforcement. Even if guns were banned, there would still be a black market for them. It would be very difficult to enforce a ban on guns, and there would likely be a lot of violence associated with the black market.<br /><br />Third, there is the issue of self-defense. Many people believe that they have a right to defend themselves and their families, and that banning guns would take away that right.<br /><br />Fourth, there is the issue of hunting. Hunting is a popular sport in America, and many people believe that banning guns would take away their ability to hunt.<br /><br />Finally, there is the issue of politics.

Gravity actually has little to do with it - it's the lack of air that makes aerodynamic surfaces like ailerons and rudders ineffective.", "answer_b": "Rockets are able to steer and move in space because they rely on the force of their engines to propel them in the desired direction. Without gravity, there is nothing to pull them back down to the surface of a planet or moon, so they can continue moving in a straight line indefinitely.

One reason is that when the pitcher or carafe is full, the weight of the water can cause the spout to open slightly, which allows water to drip or spill out. Another reason is that when the container is full, the water level is higher than the spout, so the water has to travel further to reach the spout, which can cause it to spill or dribble out. Finally, when the container is full, the water is also under more pressure, which can cause it to spill or dribble out if the spout is not opened wide enough.", "label": 2}
{"question": "Why when holding a magnifying glass in a certain angle on a sunny day causes things like wood and cotton to burn? ", "answer_a": "Sunlight carries with it energy. About a thousand watts per square meter on a good day. A 6-cm magnifying glass takes up about 0.28% of a square meter, so it will be collecting around 2.8 watts of power - that's about a fifth of a small candle. It is concentrated down to a very small area - smaller than a candle flame, and so as far as that small area is concerned, it may as well be held over a flame.", "answer_b": "A magnifying glass works by gathering the light from a larger area and focussing it into a smaller area. When using a magnifying glass normally, you're taking the light bouncing off the thing you're looking at and focussing it into your eye-hole.<newline>If you bring a magnifying glass outside on a sunny day, [this happens](https://i.imgur.com/sJxraPg.png). All the sunlight (and heat energy) that hits the whole large surface of the magnifying glass gets focused and concentrated to be hitting a MUCH smaller point. So like, if you focus the power onto a spot 1/100th the size of the glass itself, that spot gets 100x more heat on it than just being in normal sunlight. Also notice you're not creating energy here.

{"question": "how does a nuclear reactor and nuclear energy work? How does a nuclear reactor and nuclear energy work?", "answer_a": "A nuclear reactor uses radioactive materials as their fuel source. A chain reaction is started where neutrons slam into the other atoms which in turn also shoot off neutrons. But these neutrons are flying away at a high rate of speed, and they need to be slowed down a bit to make them more likely to hit another atom; this is where the moderator comes in. There are a few different things that can do this function, even just water.<newline>To control the reaction so they can make it happen more slowly over time instead of releasing all that insane energy at once, things such as control rods (which instead absorb neutrons instead of just slowing them down) are also put in the reactor.<newline>All this neutron whizzing about breaking other atoms like a cue ball on a pool table creates heat, crazy amounts of heat. This is captured via what is called the primary loop, which is water that is being circulated through the reactor both to help keep it cool and to collect that heat. This then goes to an exchanger where the primary water heats up secondary water (you don't want the primary water which is being exposed to neutron radiation to be outside the containment), and this secondary water gets turned into steam.

{"question": "Why do heavy objects fall at the same speed as light ones? Shouldn't gravity make objects which mass is greater attract each other more and therefore touch each other more quickly? Or maybe the mass of the Earth is so big that the difference between two objects in perspective is negligible, especially on the very short distance between them and the soil? Not sure... could you explain?", "answer_a": "They do attract each other more, heavy objects fall with a greater force than light objects they just fall at the same velocity. The impact of a heavy object when it hits the ground is far greater, but force = mass times acceleration so the greater mass is balanced out by the greater force.", "answer_b": "Physics. Terminal velocity is a thing that matters a lot more than it seems. Also weight/mass while related, are two separate factors out of many factors that affect speed of falling objects. I’m definitely no physics person, but I believe that a heavier object needs more time to get to terminal velocity even though with enough time it will ultimately have a greater pull on it due to being heavier. A smaller object will reach terminal velocity more quickly, but it won’t go as fast. These two things exist on a parabola where there’s a lot of overlap because there’s often not a large enough free fall. Example of physics, an average sized human’s free fall terminal velocity is about 85-90mph, but a streamlined human can get to well over 100, and a human wearing specific clothing/attire can get even faster in a fall. That’s a variance of 60-70mph ultimately in an object that’s the same mass/size/relatively same shape just oriented differently or otherwise affecting drag.", "label": 2}

{"question": "what theories are out there about what came before the Big Bang? ", "answer_a": "The current model for what happened before the big bang is known as cosmic inflation.<newline>The basic idea is that the Big Bang on its own explains many of the observations made my scientists regarding the structure of the universe. However, what is interesting is that there are several observations that the Big Bang *cannot* explain, such as:<newline>\\- why was the universe \"born\" perfectly flat?<newline>\\- why is the universe the same temperature (up to over 99% accuracy) in all directions when there hasn't been enough time for the temperature of the universe to \"even out\" all the way?<newline>\\- why aren't there various high-energy relics (like magnetic monopoles - a magnet that's only North or South, but *not both*) when the Standard Model (the current frame work of the smallest particles in physics) predicted that such relics should exist as a result of the insanely high energy of the Big Bang?<newline>\\- why did the universe begin with such low entropy (which is a measure of \"disorder\" in a system)? Especially considering the fact that entropy always increases in closed systems?<newline>After the Big Bang model became accepted in the first half of the 1900's, scientists have struggled to answer these questions above according to the framework of the Big Bang.<newline>However, in the '70s and '80s a scientist named Alan Guth came up with a model explains everything the Big Bang did, *and* also explains the unsolved observations not accounted by the Big Bang. This model is known as cosmic inflation, and put simply it is the idea that the energy in the first moments of universe wasn't in particles or radiation, but in the fabric of space itself. So what happened *before* the Big Bang is that the fabric of space itself began to exponentially inflate to an unimaginable degree, and we call the \"Big Bang\" is actually the end of this inflationary period.<newline>So then that begs the question: what happened before the inflationary period? Sadly, no one knows. It is possible that some kind of singularity existed before inflation. It is also possible that inflation never stopped, which would imply the existence of a multiverse.

{"question": "Since force is related to a change in momentum and not necessarily just to a change in velocity, what would be an example where only the mass of a body changes but not its velocity when subjected to a force? ", "answer_a": "Momentum is something that exists in mass. If you apply a force, it inherently *must* change an object's velocity (however slightly) and does not change its mass.<newline>To increase the momentum of an object, you must decrease the momentum of another object, as momentum is a conserved quantity. Note that momentum is a vector, and so a \"decrease\" could just as well mean an increase in the opposite direction. The force 'moves' momentum between the two objects.<newline>The force could, instead, move mass between the two objects, but the scenario is a bit odd, since the new mass isn't necessarily the same object but simply travels alongside the object.<newline>For example, imagine a very fast aircraft flying over enemy territory. So fast that it keeps pace with bullets. The enemy fires upon the aircraft, but the bullets can only match speeds with it and will not damage it. The bullets are now traveling with the aircraft, and with some mid-flight gluing they could become a part of it. In this case, the force of firing the bullet is pumping mass to the object without changing its velocity.", "answer_b": "My first thought was particle accelerators where the particles are close to the universal speed limit and will therefore not go any faster no matter how much acceleration you give them but will instead increase in mass.

{"question": "If under anesthesia do you get your sleep needed for the day?<br />", "answer_a": "No. The unconsciousness induced by both IV anesthetics and inhaled anesthetics is very different from restorative sleep. In fact, patients in ICUs who are sedated for long periods of time with some of the same medications they use in anesthesia get delirium from both a lack of sleep and a lack of proper awake time. <br />This is also true for prescription benzodiazepines like Ativan (lorazepam) and Xanax (alprazolam) which are often prescribed for insomnia but do not produce true sleep. <br />There is an IV sedative called Dexmedetomodine (precedex) that produces an unconsciousness more similar to sleep and has been shown to reduce the risk of ICU delirium vs more common medications like propofol. It is also used as an adjunct in anesthetic practice. But it is not nearly as prominent as propofol or inhaled anesthetics for a few reasons. First, it takes longer to work so after a dose you have to wait 15-30min for it to take effect (propofol is within a minute or so) and it lasts longer once it is stopped. Additionally, up until recently it was on patent and quite expensive. The patent recently expired and it is seeing increased use but I doubt it will ever become as popular as propofol.  <br />EDIT: Precedex also isn't a full anesthetic in standard practice so for surgery under general anesthesia it still needs to be used with another medicine like propofol or anesthesia gas.

One reason is that the hair follicles on the top of the head are more sensitive to a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a byproduct of testosterone and is found in both men and women. When DHT levels are high, it can cause the hair follicles on the top of the head to miniaturize, which leads to hair loss. Another reason is that the hair on the sides and back of the head is not as exposed to the sun and other environmental factors, which can damage the hair and lead to hair loss.", "answer_b": "Seems unsettled but here’s a theory:<br />“The most recent hypothesis suggests that the hair loss process begins during puberty, when growth of the skull and the muscles in the forehead and neck increases the tension in a tight band of tissue stretching over the top of the head. The more DHT (a type of testosterone) there is, the more these muscles contract, which causes inflammation and brings in more DHT. Over time, the DHT thickens the band of tissue, restricting the supply of blood and nutrients to the hair follicles above it. The follicles on top of the head get smaller and eventually disappear, while those on the sides of the head remain largely unaffected.”<br />Source<br />https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-do-men-go-bald-from-the-top-of-their-heads/", "label": 1}

Wouldn't they only have half of the normal mass/size of a single-child pregnancy? I mean, if a fertilized egg splits and the two fragments can form into two normal sized humans, wouldn't that mean if the egg never split, the single human would have the mass/size of the two twins combined? Does the cell somehow know that it split, and somehow it then knows that despite losing half of what it already had as a single egg, it needs to develop as if it never had the material from the portion that split off? Sorry if this sounds like rambling, but I can't find any information on this topic online.", "answer_a": "The egg does not contain all the material of the final human being. Eggs are large by cell standards - they're about the size of the period at the end of this sentence if you're using a typical monitor - but they're much smaller than a fetus or newborn child.<br />And in fact, the fertilized egg *doesn't* typically split in half with identical twins. Instead, identical twins diverge a little later in development (a few days in) during the split between the cells that form the placenta and the cells that form what will eventually be the final human. A single layer of cells (called the *trophoblast*) forms the placenta, and inside that is a blob of cells (the \"inner cell mass\") that forms the embryo. In identical twins, *two* inner cell masses form instead of one. But at this point the placenta attaches to and begins receiving nutrients from the uterine wall.<br />So while the two embyros begin slightly smaller than they otherwise would, they have access to outside nutrients very early in development, and it's those outside nutrients that enable actual growth in size.", "answer_b": "> Does the cell somehow know that it split, and somehow it then knows that despite losing half of what it already had as a single egg, it needs to develop as if it never had the material from the portion that split off? <br />Essentially, yes.

{"question": "How are deep sea animals not more resilient at the surface?<br />This might sound like a dumb question but I promise I'm serious. I was watching a video on the depth of the ocean and it got me curious how deep sea creatures don't immediately squash under all that pressure. I did some reading on it and from what I saw, fish/squid/etc lack swim bladders and as a result lack anything left in their bodies to be compressed. Yet I'm still a bit confused on how these animals even open their mouths under all that weight.. how they have an open stomach. Wouldn't that be flattened as well? The only thing I could think of is that the pressure inside their bodies maybe equalize the pressure on the outside.<br />Which brings me the to the last part of the question. As a part of that video, I saw that a leatherback sea turtle has a maximum diving depth of 1,280 meters. Yet just before that it mentioned that the pressure that far down is roughly equivalent to a polar bear standing on a postage stamp. I can kind of overlook how fish do it, but I can't really imagine a polar bear standing on a sea turtle's face and it be just fine. I can't even imagine me being able to punch a sea turtle in the face and it being fine. Yet apparently it's somehow invincible.", "answer_a": "Fill a baloon with water. Immerse it in water.

One reason is that they lack swim bladders, which helps them to float. Without this, they would sink to the bottom of the ocean and be crushed by the pressure. Another reason is that they have a higher density than surface animals, which makes it harder for them to float. Finally, deep sea animals have adapted to the high pressure and cold temperatures of the deep ocean, and would not be able to survive in the warmer, shallower waters of the surface.", "label": 2}

{"question": "Why do people go bald on the top of their head and still have some on the sides and not vice-versa?<br />", "answer_a": "There are a few reasons why people go bald on the top of their head and still have some hair on the sides. One reason is that the hair follicles on the top of the head are more sensitive to a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a byproduct of testosterone and is found in both men and women. When DHT levels are high, it can cause the hair follicles on the top of the head to miniaturize, which leads to hair loss. Another reason is that the hair on the sides and back of the head is not as exposed to the sun and other environmental factors, which can damage the hair and lead to hair loss.", "answer_b": "Seems unsettled but here’s a theory:<br />“The most recent hypothesis suggests that the hair loss process begins during puberty, when growth of the skull and the muscles in the forehead and neck increases the tension in a tight band of tissue stretching over the top of the head. The more DHT (a type of testosterone) there is, the more these muscles contract, which causes inflammation and brings in more DHT. Over time, the DHT thickens the band of tissue, restricting the supply of blood and nutrients to the hair follicles above it. The follicles on top of the head get smaller and eventually disappear, while those on the sides of the head remain largely unaffected.”<br />Source<br />https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-do-men-go-bald-from-the-top-of-their-heads/", "label": 1}

Or does it have a serious reason?<br />I asked my brother this question and he said that they say that to prevent people going into shock, but he answered quite unsure. And if this is the answer, why would we prevent people from going into shock. Your body goes into shock to stay alive longer, so wouldn't it be a good thing? <br />I couldn't find anything on google, but maybe that's just because I'm bad at finding things on google.

ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce adrenaline,  and norepinephrine.<br />Epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, and cortisol all act to contract blood vessels and raise blood pressure.  The first two raise heart rate and increse breathing rate. Cortisol releases glucose from the liver. <br />This can all reduce blood loss from an injury.

{"question": "If under anesthesia do you get your sleep needed for the day?<br />", "answer_a": "No. The unconsciousness induced by both IV anesthetics and inhaled anesthetics is very different from restorative sleep.

It is also used as an adjunct in anesthetic practice. But it is not nearly as prominent as propofol or inhaled anesthetics for a few reasons. First, it takes longer to work so after a dose you have to wait 15-30min for it to take effect (propofol is within a minute or so) and it lasts longer once it is stopped. Additionally, up until recently it was on patent and quite expensive. The patent recently expired and it is seeing increased use but I doubt it will ever become as popular as propofol.  <br />EDIT: Precedex also isn't a full anesthetic in standard practice so for surgery under general anesthesia it still needs to be used with another medicine like propofol or anesthesia gas.

Central banks can print more money, but this can cause inflation, which reduces the value of money. Money is also a scarce resource, which is why we use it as a unit of exchange.<br /><br />There are different types of money, including fiat money, commodity money, and cryptocurrency. Fiat money is money that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver. Commodity money is money that is backed by a physical commodity. Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure its transactions.", "answer_b": "The US uses a Fiat Currency and its value is derived from the supply and demand for it like anything else.<br />Governments can and do print money. Theoretically they could print money to pay for all government services, so why don't they?<br />The answer is inflation. The more money in circulation the less its overall value.<br />Ever see a loaf of bread go for $1000? You can, and you will!<br />Post WW2 German and several African nations are examples of extreme inflation, where the government kept printing money but it crippled its value. So while it helped in the short term to fix their problems, printing money eventually caused the money to be worth less than toilet paper.", "label": 2}
{"question": "With seemingly half of downtown Manhatten's commercial real estate being vacant, why do real estate agents prefer having a venue vacant over just lowering prices? I'm not a U.S. citizen, but the whole thing going on on [Louis Rossman's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpC4IGAkgok) (who runs the Right to Repair movement, but also makes video about the ridiculousness of New York real estate) intrigues me. <br />You see hundreds upon hundreds vacant stores 'for rent', while they still ask the same ridiculous prices (up to $55,000 a month for a store). Rossman has seen stores that have been vacant and for rent for literally over 5 years, while te price stays the same. <br />What do real estate brokers gain from this? Do they just hope that \\*someone\\* jumps the boat and deny that prices are too high? Enlighten me :)", "answer_a": "a lot of it is investment for speculation.

{"question": "How the tax rates are determined by governments? I would assume that governments estimate the amount of extra money they need to finance public healthcare, pensions, infrastructure improvements, etc. They make the projection for the coming years, add some safety gap on top and then calculate the tax rate based on this required amount of extra income. Is that true?<br />If so, such calculation leads us to a flat tax rate. If we are talking about a progressive tax, how are the decisions about tax bands and rates for each band made?", "answer_a": "Governments use a variety of methods to determine tax rates. In some cases, rates are set based on the amount of money the government needs to raise to fund specific programs or initiatives. In other cases, tax rates may be based on a percentage of income, with higher earners paying a higher rate. Additionally, some governments use a progressive tax system, in which tax rates increase as income increases.", "answer_b": "You'd be wrong.<br />The legislature gets input from economic calculations, in the US from the Congressional Budget Office, but more often than not the numbers are chosen to send political messages.<br />There are very, very few flat tax systems.  Almost all systems are extremely progressive, what's the point of collecting taxes from some poor person who you make social safety net payments to?  That would just be government using taxes to collect its own money.  Tax bands are set politically, trading off the influence of the rich with the influence of the anti-rich.

If so, I’m sure quite a bit of currency was withdrawn from circulation, as well.", "answer_b": "There are a few reasons why the inflation rate is not 20% despite the fact that 20% of all US dollars were printed in the last year. First, it takes time for new money to enter the economy and start circulating. Second, not all of the new money will end up being used to purchase goods and services; some of it may be saved or used to pay off debt, for example. Finally, the inflation rate is calculated using a basket of goods and services, so it may not reflect the impact of new money on the prices of specific goods and services.", "label": 2}

Basically, the government sells a bond to someone, and after a set amount of time that bond can be redeemed for it's face value, and with interest. The functional value of a bond is built entirely on the value of the government (or company) that backs the bond; if that government is perceived as stable, then the bond retains value, because there's a perception that the bond will be paid when it comes due.<br />In turn, bonds are an investment. They're, generally, slightly better than cash, entirely because bonds grow in face value over time, whereas cash does not.", "answer_b": "Yes they do. Example is America borrowing from China. What happens is America issues bonds. When someone purchases a bond they are essentially lending there money for a specified amount of time. (In bond language it’s called a term). Once the term of the bond is fulfilled America conducts another bond offering (lending more money ) in order to pay down some of the debt with the proceeds it collects from a bond sale. It’s called rolling over the debt. It’s a continuous cycle that America will never get out of.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Why do some countries measure their currencies in large units? For example in Vietnam, lunch can be bought for 50,000 VD and in South Korea, apartments can cost several MILLION Won. Why do some countries use such large denominations?", "answer_a": "It is actually the inflation's side effect.<br />The money worth less than the paper they paint it on. So, they use a higher number.<br />You can see how it begins (again) in Turkish Lira. In 2007, Turkey removed 6 zeroes from the money (ie 10 million TLs become 10 TLs). The $/TL was something like 1.20.<br />Now, $/TL is 8.65. TL loses it's worth. <br />To somewhat counter that, countries issue higher bills. So that the minimum wages can keep up against the inflation and people can afford basic stuff like electricity bills and such.", "answer_b": "There are a few reasons why some countries might choose to measure their currency in large units. One reason is that it can help to combat inflation. When prices are rising rapidly, it can be difficult to keep track of the value of goods and services if the currency is divided into small units. It can also be difficult to make change for small purchases. If the currency is measured in larger units, it can be easier for people to keep track of the value of goods and services and to make change. Another reason for using large units of currency is that it can make transactions more efficient. For example, if you are buying a car for $1,000, it is more efficient to pay in one $1,000 bill than to pay in ten $100 bills. Finally, large units of currency can also make it easier to track money laundering and other illicit financial activities. If all transactions are conducted in large units of currency, it can be easier to track the flow of money and to identify suspicious activity.", "label": 2}

First, hunger and homelessness are complex problems that require more than just financial resources to solve. Addressing hunger and homelessness requires a coordinated effort from governments, NGOs, and private individuals and organizations. Second, even if the world's richest people were to donate all of their wealth to ending hunger and homelessness, it would not be enough. The scale of the problem is simply too large. It is estimated that it would cost $30 billion per year to end hunger, and $20 billion per year to end homelessness. Third, the world's richest people are not all philanthropists.

First, tax revenue is one of the main ways that governments fund public goods and services. Without tax revenue, governments would have to rely on other sources of funding, which might not be as stable or reliable. Second, tax helps to reduce income inequality by redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor. This is especially important in countries with a large income gap between the rich and the poor.

{"question": "Would burning money help with the inflation problem in Venezuela for example? ", "answer_a": "No.<br />Paper money is a tiny fraction of the actual money.  Most money is just numbers in bank accounts.", "answer_b": "Hyper inflation occurs when people, lenders, foreign companies e.t.c lose confidence in the currency. <br />If I'm a shop owner and I usually sell an apple for 1 coin. However I'm not convinced in a month I'll be able to buy myself enough food/pay rent e.t.c by selling apples for 1 coin. So I raise my prices today to protect myself against currency changes in the future. This of course spirals out of control because everyone starts doing this.<br />Because the value is changing fast, there is no point saving money, so everyone tries to spend all their money at once before it's value is rapidly eroded to zero. Often money will be spent the same day it is earned - and everyone spending every penny every day pushes up prices more and the cycle continues. <br />The only way to fix the issue is to make people trust the currency again. This is usually done by adopting a stable foreign currency or pegging your currency to a foreign currency. (Brazil effectively stopped hyperinflation).", "label": 1}

You get to the till with your products, which you now need to pay for, but instead of handing over cash directly, you ask the shop to deal directly with your bank. The shop phones up the bank and asks them to take X amount of money out of your account, then nip over to the shops own bank and give it to them on your behalf, which they do.<br />That is pretty much how a credit or debit card works, just automated with computers...", "answer_b": "Debit cards are linked to a bank account and whenever you pay using a debit card, the amount is deducted from the bank account on completion of the transaction. So, instead of withdrawing and handing over cash for a purchase, you can swipe the card.<br />Credit cards come with a credit limit and a defined billing cycle (generally monthly).

{"question": "There is all this talk about global USD shortage despite trillions that were printed in the last 2 years, what gives? ", "answer_a": "If you go back in time prior to 1990 most of the world's debt is denominated in the local currency of the country where the debt was made.  So if I'm an Indian oil refiner and I want to get a loan to build a new plant, I go to a bank and get a loan that I have to pay back in Indian Rupees.  Similarly, if I'm the government of Vietnam and I want to get a loan to build a new highway, I'll go to a bank and get a loan that needs to be paid back in Vietnamese Dong (no they're not cutting people's penises off, that's what the currency there is called).<br />The problem with this is that most of the loans that are being made to countries outside of the US/EU/Japan are being made by the US/EU/Japan.  Countries outside of that area are also incredibly corrupt.  So what happens when the Vietnamese government can't afford to pay back its loan?  It prints a shitload of Dong and uses the freshly printed currency to pay off its debt.  Because of how many Dong have been printed to satisfy this debt, the value of the Dong collapses and the lender is left with a pile of worthless currency.<br />The solution that lenders in the US/EU/Japan came up with for this problem was to make it so that borrowers outside of those regions have to pay back their loans in dollars.  Now it doesn't matter how much the Vietnamese government devalues its currency - it still has to pay back the same amount of dollars.  <br />Most corporate/national debt is made in the form of 20 or 30 year bonds.  In a 20 year bond you make a small interest payment each year.  Then, at the end of the 20 years, you pay back *the entirety of what you were initially loaned*.  <br />So imagine you take a $100 loan, paid back over 20 years with an interest rate of 1%.  Each year you pay the lender $1 (1% of $100).  Then on year 20 you pay $101 (the original $100 value of the loan plus your final interest payment).  That means that to make your debt payment for year 20, you need 101 times as many dollars as you did to make your payment in year 19.<br />Right now all of the early dollar denominated loans to the third world are starting the hit that point where the borrowers need to make that big, final payment.  That's causing a sudden surge in the need for companies and governments to get dollars.  <br />You can view the China Evergrande situation as being a direct result of this.  Evergrande needs to make the final payment on a lot of its 20/30 year bonds right now.  It has physical assets with a sufficient value to do this (it owns a lot of land and buildings).  The problem is it can't hand the buildings to its creditors because of Chinese government restrictions on foreign land ownership.  It needs to sell the buildings to get dollars to pay off its loans.  But it needs so many dollars so quickly that its hard to find people that have that many dollars at once.", "answer_b": "There are a few different factors at play here. First, the US dollar is still considered the global reserve currency, meaning that it is used more than any other currency for international transactions. This means that demand for dollars is always high, even when there is a lot of them in circulation.<br /><br />Second, the trillions of dollars that were printed in the last two years were mostly used to bail out banks and other financial institutions. This money never actually made it into the hands of consumers, so it didn't really increase the overall money supply.<br /><br />Lastly, the global economy is still recovering from the last recession, and many countries are still dealing with high levels of debt. This means that there is less demand for USD-denominated assets, and that the dollar is under more pressure than it has been in recent years.", "label": 2}

For example if you go into Steam's settings you can in and select where you want your download to be done from. Steam has machines in all these locations, and those \"terabits\" are each location added up together.

{"question": "Why is a pc download size and a console dowoad size different for the same game?

One reason is that the PC version of a game might be more graphically demanding than the console version, and thus require more data to be downloaded. Another reason is that the PC version of a game might include more content than the console version - for example, extra levels, bonus features, etc. Finally, it's also possible that the PC version of a game is simply a higher-quality version than the console version, and thus requires more data to be downloaded.", "answer_b": "Primarily because of the varying settings. All xboxes or all ps5s or whatever console are all fairly uniform in every part of their hardware except maybe overall harddrive space. They process things all the same way so there's no need to account for variance. PCs vary so much in processing power and capabilities that you'd more likely have trouble finding two that are exactly the same. <br />The game producers have to account for this by creating a game that looks nice enough that it doesn't appear to be outdated, but keep requirements low enough that users with lower end PCs can still run them even if they have to change the graphics settings to do so.

{"question": "How are cryptographic keys used to encrypt and decrypt data? In asymmetric encryption, we have a public and a private key. The way I understand it: The public key is a string that's known to everyone who communicates with someone who receives encrypted data and is used to convert data into cipher. The private key is another string that is only known to the receiver and *only that string* can be used to decrypt the data. How does that work if both strings are different?<br />Re symmetric encryption, again it's a mystery to me how a string is used to encrypt some other data but at least the key is the same and not a completely different sequence of characters.", "answer_a": "It seems you have a decent working knowledge of encryption, but because this is eli5, consider this instead of the literal process.<br />In symmetric encryption, you have a lock box that can be locked or unlocked by only one key. That key is shared between two parties, and is responsible for both locking and unlocking.<br />In asymmetric encryption things get a bit spicier. The key metaphor breaks down, BUT you can imagine a public key to be a sealable box offered out to everyone. Once the box is sealed (with something inside) and it's sent back through the metaphorical mail, it can only be opened by the person who originally offered out the box because of manners and laws.<br />In reality the later can only occur due to math pioneered in the RSA algorithm which some folks even struggle with at 25. Just know that the products of large primes are involved, and tend to generate intermediate products in the hundreds of trillions.", "answer_b": "So, first thing to realise is that Cryptography deals with numbers.

Then throw away all but the last 2 digits. You get what you start with.<br />We can split this number into factors. What 2 numbers can we multiply together to get 201? 67, and 3 work.  We can do this multiply and keep the last digits trick with each of these.<br />3 is our public key. 67 is our private key<br />So start with 61.    <br />Multiply by our public key to get 183.     <br />Keep the last 2 digits as our \"encrypted\" number - 83<br />To get and multiply by our private key of 67<br />83x67=5561.    <br />Take the last two digits and we have the number we started with.<br />So that illustrates the basic idea of asymmetric functions. But we can't use multiplication because it's too easy to reverse. We can do something similar with different mathematical operations though. Using powers of primes, in different numerical bases is one such operation. And there are formulas to generate  the numbers that will work for this.", "label": 1}
{"question": "What is Programming and why is it important to the world? ", "answer_a": "Programming is the instructions that every electronic device uses to make them do what we want them to. Your cell phone, computer, alarm clock, car, tv, all have programs that allow them to function.", "answer_b": "Computers are complicated machines which can follow a huge variety of simple instructions (known as code) written in specific languages. Programming is basically creating recipes of these instructions for computers to do things. You can almost think of it like combinations of magic spells to make computers do special things. <br />Anyway these recipes (or combinations of spells, if you will) can be very large and complex, and they are made to allow computers to do cool things for people who don't know these special computer spells or recipes. So by setting the computers up with these spells, programmers make it possible for non-programmers (muggles?) to use computers for things like posting such questions and getting responses on reddit, or searching for things online, or playing games, or watching cat videos.<br />Edit: should have also mentioned phones here, but I'm old school.", "label": 1}
{"question": "how cloud storage is different than just storing my files on someone else's hard drive ", "answer_a": "Well, it is just storing your files on someone else's hard drive. However the difference mainly comes in the fact most cloud storage solutions have way more infrastructure set up to make it as smooth as possible for you. They are always online, they can be accessed from anywhere, they probably have backups upon backups, they likely have better security than a random person with a hard drive, and so on and so forth. <br />Cloud services offer the service of your files being accessible from anywhere, at any time, without you having to worry about the details.", "answer_b": "Cloud storage is a model of data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on \"the cloud\". The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company. These cloud storage providers are responsible for keeping the data safe and accessible, and the user is responsible for managing access to their data. <br /><br />Cloud storage is different than just storing files on someone else's hard drive in a few key ways. First, with cloud storage the user does not have direct control over the physical storage of their data. Second, cloud storage providers typically offer more robust security and protection against data loss than most individuals could provide on their own. Finally, cloud storage providers often offer additional features and services, such as versioning and access control, that can be difficult or impossible to replicate on one's own.", "label": 2}

How it works is that it takes in input data, processes it, and then produces an output. The processing that it does is based on a set of rules or patterns that it has learned from previous experience.", "answer_b": "A neural network is made up of neurons.<br />The neurons of a neural network are basically just pieces of code. Very simple individually. They simply take one or more numbers as inputs, perform some mathematical calculations, then spit out and output. Very commonly the calculation they perform is to multiply each input by some number (a weight), then add the results all together and put out the sum.<br />You take a bunch of neurons and arrange them in layers. Each output from each neuron in one layer feeds into each input of each neuron in the next layer.<br />The first and last layers of the network are special. The neurons of the first layer generally only take a single input and the last layer consists of a single neuron that takes, as input, all of the outputs of the layer above it and then provides a single sum (as normal) but \"normalizes\" that sum by forcing it to be a value between 0 or 1 (or sometimes forcing it to be only 0 or 1).<br />The \"magic\" of neural networks are the chosen weights for each neuron. Since neural networks can get fairly complex, there are some strategies, often involving feedback loops, where you can \"train\" a neural network on known data to produce the desired output, then unleash it on unknown data.", "label": 1}
{"question": "If modern operating systems have trouble running old applications, how do modern video cards render graphics in old games? ", "answer_a": "There are a few ways that modern video cards can render graphics in old games. One way is by using an emulator, which is a software program that imitates the hardware of an older system. This allows old games to run on modern systems, but can sometimes result in poorer graphics quality. Another way is by using a graphics processor that is specifically designed to render graphics in old games. These processors can provide better quality graphics than emulators, but may not be compatible with all games.", "answer_b": "Very simply put: the *basic* communication standard for video games (driver, API etc) etc has been the same for many years, hence the ability to run old games. Even far older games from the MS DOS area could run with emulators and virtual machines, and services like GOG make money with bringing old games to current operating systems.<br />Imagine having an old car from the 1920 ... could probably still drive on a highway, but not very nice & shiny. <br />SYL", "label": 2}

{"question": "why do we need Cmos batteries on motherboards instead of just having a small flash storage. ", "answer_a": "There are a few reasons why CMOS batteries are used on motherboards instead of just having a small flash storage. <br /><br />One reason is that the CMOS battery can provide a constant power supply to the motherboard, even when the computer is turned off. This is important because the CMOS battery stores important information about the computer's settings, such as the date and time. If the CMOS battery runs out of power, these settings will be reset and the computer will not be able to function properly. <br /><br />Another reason is that CMOS batteries are not as susceptible to data loss as flash storage. This is because CMOS batteries retain their data even when the power is off, whereas flash storage needs power in order to keep its data intact. This means that CMOS batteries are more reliable for storing important data. <br /><br />Overall, CMOS batteries are more efficient and reliable than flash storage for storing data on motherboards.", "answer_b": "Using true nonvolatile storage is possible and sometimes done these days.<br />But the battery is used to still run the clock when physically unplugged or PSU switched fully off.

{"question": "Why are save game files so small compared to the game itself? ", "answer_a": "The game save isn't a whole new copy of the game, it's just a list of the stuff the game needs to remember about your character, inventory, location, progress through missions or dialogue trees, things like that. It doesn't need another copy of the physics engine or map (sometimes it needs the map, like in games like Minecraft where the map isn't the same between different saves).", "answer_b": "Imagine a map of the world. It's incredibly detailed and large, right? Now, on that map, I need to specify where I am. Despite how large and detailed this map is, I only need two pieces of information: my latitude and longitude. I don't need an entire copy of the map to specify my location, because I already have a map. I just need the relevant pieces of information.<br />Game saves work in a similar way.

If you walk into the studio of a sculpter he will have all the tools needed to make a sculpture, arranged in a sensible manner, with materials and such to assist.  If you walk into the studio of a painter she might have a few of the tools needed to make a sculpture, but not all, and they may be hard to find as she really never uses them (or uses them for something else).<br />Thus game engines are usually designed for types of games but if you want to make a space combat flight simulator the tools available in an engine mostly designed for 2D side scroller games wouldn't be the best.", "answer_b": "You can also build your own engine to suit your needs but it will take much more work.

{"question": "Why before 2012 I was told to use two sticks of RAM for gaming and now people are advising me to buy four in order to get maximum performance? ", "answer_a": "Dual and quad channel.<br />Dual channel means the CPU and motherboard can use two sticks at once, doubling the performance. This means the performance of the memory, mind you, not of the entire system.<br />In modern times you have quad channel which is the same sort of thing -- the board and CPU can talk to all 4 RAM sticks at once.<br />Which means that a configuration of say, one 32 GB stick will be slower than 8+8+8+8.<br />In practice though the performance difference isn't as huge as it sounds, because from the point of view of a CPU, RAM is very slow, and the CPU uses its own internal cache whenever it can. This means the speed of RAM only matters when the CPU doesn't have what it needs on hand. This means that 4X faster memory might actually translate to a 10-20% real performance difference.<br />Still, if your board has support for it, lower size RAM sticks are cheaper, and you don't see the need to add more in the future, there's really no reason not to do it. A small performance benefit is better than none in any case.<br />If you look for benchmarks you may find some very confusing results -- some games don't care about dual/quad channel at all, some have huge performance differences. That's because different games use memory differently. A small, lightweight game probably won't benefit much. A game that pushes the limits and uses lots of RAM will probably benefit quite noticeably though.", "answer_b": "The reason people are advising you to buy four sticks of RAM instead of two is because of the way RAM is distributed across the different channels on your motherboard. Most motherboards have four RAM slots, which are divided into two channels. If you have two sticks of RAM, they will be placed in the two slots on one of the channels. This can lead to a performance bottleneck, because the CPU can only access one stick of RAM at a time on that channel. However, if you have four sticks of RAM, they can be placed in the slots on both channels, which will allow the CPU to access two sticks of RAM at the same time and thus increase your gaming performance.", "label": 1}

One reason is that chess computers can evaluate a large number of possible moves very quickly and accurately, something that humans are not capable of doing. Another reason is that chess computers are not susceptible to making the kinds of mistakes that humans often make, such as getting tired, emotional, or distracted.

{"question": "What is happening inside the computer when it \"bricks\"? So I heard the term 'bricked' when people were complaining about Fallout 76 bugs. What is happening inside the computer that a video game makes the computer not turn on?", "answer_a": "Usually, an important ROM (Read Only Memory) that contains important data (For example the most basic information on how to turn on, how to decode input from the keyboard, etc) is damaged. So when you start the computer (PC or a PSP or something else), it does not know what to do next!<br />Technically, companies are able to fix a bricked device but they usually don't. I remember Sony would replace your PSP and gave you a new one with a relatively small fee.<br />I don't know if a game would brick a PC though. Usually, it happens when you are upgrading the firmware/BIOS. Games don't have access to that.", "answer_b": "So \"bricked\" when used with the Fallout 76 stuff is a bit of a misnomer. \"bricking\" electronics means damaging an internal component or software in such a way that you can NEVER recover from it. <br />Wiping core system ROMS, heating system beyond normal and destroying components, wiping BIOS are all forms of \"bricking\" ( you computer is as good as a \"brick\" now, doesn't and won't do anything)<br />The fallout 76 game was terribly optimized and was overheating people poorly built, or poorly cooled systems. To be fair to Fallout, if their system was that poorly designed, a failure was inevitable. People also reported it breaking their OS and windows would not boot anymore, but that is not \"bricking\" in the traditional sense. What you heard from the media was hype over a hated game.

{"question": "How do memory products such as an SD card or flash drive store memory and keep it saved when it doesn't have a power source?

When you remove the SD card or flash drive from your computer, the chip continues to hold the stored data. Even if there is no power source, the data will remain stored on the chip until it is erased.", "answer_b": "You might be familiar with transistors. They are basically tiny switches. One kind of transistor called Field Effect Transistor (FET) conducts electricity if you apply a voltage to its gate. If you remove the voltage it doesn’t conduct (or vice-versa, there are two flavours).<br />https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/rel-assets/dsauto/temp/uploaded/What_is_mosfet.png?w=1042<br />The nice thing about FETs is that almost no current flows through the gate. <br />Flash memory is millions of special FETs with “floating” gates.<br />The gate has a tiny capacitance which means it can hold a tiny bit of charge.

", "answer_a": "Not sure why everyone here is saying it's super expensive to restore deleted files. <br />Free ware programs can often recover files over written by 0.", "answer_b": "When the hard drive is writing it's basically turning a sequence of electric pulses into magnetic fields being one direction or another.<br />If I overwrite a 1 with a 0, it's going to trying to turn the magnetic domain on that area of the platter 180 degrees. Because it's only a pulse, the magnetic field may only turn 175 degrees or 170 degrees. It's still clearly the other direction but not quite aligned. If I overwrite a 0 with a 0 it's going to reinforce the direction of the magnetic domain because the pulse is going to drag whatever crystals are almost in line even further in line with the magnetic field lines.<br />Now say I run over that disk but instead of looking for north-south alignment I look for magnetic domains that are close to perfectly aligned and magnetic domains that are out of alignment.

What makes it confusing is that both browning and blueing are making an iron oxide layer, and a blued finish will, on exposure to the elements ( like, someone goes hunting) bit by bit revert to regular brown rust, so quite a lot of guns are now brown that were once blue ( there's a gunsmith invocation over blueing: \"from rust you came, to rust you shall return\"). <br />In the later 1800's it was discovered that a phosphate coating could be created that was more stable than blueing or browning.

{"question": "When the joint-stock company was first invented, was there a lot of pushback on the concept? What were some of the concerns?  Also any recommended books on the invention of the concept would be much appreciated!", "answer_a": "An early form of joint stock ventures appeared in Assyria by the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE. There does not seem to have been any noticeable pushback against the concept, although trade caravans were often taxed heavily. Of course, the relevant texts were written to and from people engaged in trade, so there's no way of knowing what other Assyrians thought of long distance trade. <br />>Most of these traders had become more independent by having become managers of a \"joint-stock fund\" (called *naruqqum*, \"money bag\"), usually set up in Assur. This phenomenon appeared for the first time around 1900 BC and seems to have been an Old Assyrian invention that went beyond individual partnerships and cooperation in a joint caravan. The arrangement, rather similar to that of the early medieval *compagnia*, meant enlisting a number (usually about a dozen) of investors (*ummiānum*, \"financiers\"), who supplied capital rated in gold, usually in all ca. 30 kilos, ideally consisting of shares of 1 or 2 kilos of gold each. It was entrusted to a trader (the tractator), usually for ca. ten years, for the generally formulated purpose of \"carrying out trade.\" The contract contained stipulations on a final settlement of accounts, on paying dividends, on the division of the expected profit, and on fines for premature withdrawal of capital (meant to secure the duration of the business). Investors or shareholders mostly lived in Assur, but successful traders in Anatolia too invested in funds managed by others, perhaps also as a way of sharing commercial risks.

{"question": "I'm reading through Ketcham's biography of Madison and I came on this quote just after Madison become Secretary of State describing a job seeker who<br />>began hopefully with a request for a territorial governorship, gradually descended to pleas to be appointed a port collector or postmaster, and ended finally... with a request for castoff clothing<br />This sounds very similar to something from Team of Rivals where Lincoln told a very similar story of someone settling for pants. Would one or both of these have been fictional stories told as jokes? Might Lincoln have taken the story from Madison? Or was this a common way that these job seekers asked for stuff?", "answer_a": "It is possible that Madison and Lincoln were both telling jokes, as it is common for politicians to tell stories to make a point.

Of all the Founding Fathers. Madison was the consummate deal maker, and it's easy to imagine the story originating with him. <br /> But Andrew Jackson was the most notorious practitioner of awarding posts to friends:  before him, chances were at least pretty good that a Federalist would be able to keep his job if a Democratic President came to power. But Jackson wanted a bureaucracy loyal to him, correctly saw that rewarding office seekers with positions was a way to gain political support in their regions, and was quick to terminate people in order to get it. By Lincoln's administration, it was very much expected that a there would be a major turnover in positions coming in with his election, so your story was certainly a joke- a wry one, as Lincoln had plenty of men hanging about the White House getting in his way, hoping for just such a chance.  But the joke had a point, both for Madison and Lincoln- there had to be a quid pro quo, as the office seeker was expected to bring some local influence, bring the support of a Congressman, an electoral district; something useful. A man without influence might well only be able to beg for a pair of pants.<br />Real civil service reform was begun by Garfield, and after he was shot by an office seeker, carried on to everyone's surprise by  Chester A.

{"question": "Has there been any battles in history where both sides were completely and mutually destroyed?", "answer_a": "In normal conditions, this would not happen, since casualty rates in historical battles are rarely that extreme. In ancient warfare the defeated side might incur something like 10-20% casualties unless things went disastrously wrong. In modern warfare a unit that has lost more than 30% effectives is considered unfit for action.<br />Most of the time, the deciding factor is morale. Warriors simply aren't going to keep on fighting when they see their buddies falling left and right and they see no way of turning things around. They're going to try to get out of there, find a place of safety, and regroup if they can; or they're going to surrender. When the situation is hopeless, most armies will give up the fight, and this will happen long before they come anywhere near total annihilation. In fact, in premodern warfare the great majority of casualties were sustained when the side that broke first was fleeing from the battlefield with the victorious side in hot pursuit.<br />So, given these conditions, what would you need to achieve mutual destruction? You'd need two sides that were roughly evenly matched and utterly determined never to give up. The necessary attitude may sometimes be found among the last defenders of a town or fortress, but of course you would never get two such forces fighting each other; in most cases where one side is prepared to fight to the end, the other side is vastly superior and not similarly inclined. The result would be either the annihilation of the defenders or the flight of the attackers - never mutual destruction.<br />There is one case from Greek history that meets your requirements, though, by virtue of being artificially created and utterly exceptional: the so-called Battle of the Champions, fought around 550 BC between the Spartans and the Argives (Herodotos 1.82). When the two armies met, they agreed to settle their dispute over a border region by each choosing 300 champions, and letting those men fight it out. It seems these picked forces were a match for each other, because all 600 men died, except for two Argives and one Spartan. At that point the two Argives left the battlefield and declared themselves victorious. The Spartan stayed behind, stripped the dead of their armour, and declared himself victorious. <br />There is no other example of a prearranged battle like this in Greek history. The reason is obvious: it was a complete failure, since the two sides couldn't agree on who had won, and in the end they decided to launch their whole armies into an all-out battle anyway. But because of the artificial conditions and the dedication of the 600 champions, it's the closest a battle ever got to complete destruction on both sides.", "answer_b": "There have been a few instances in history where both sides in a battle were completely and mutually destroyed. One example is the Battle of Cannae during the Second Punic War, in which the Carthaginian forces led by Hannibal annihilated a much larger Roman army.

{"question": "What does the term \"metal road/metaled road\" mean and where did it come from? I have frequently seen it in archeology reports, or when Brits are speaking. I presume it to mean an improved road of some sort like gravel or paved road as opposed to a plain dirt road.", "answer_a": "The term \"metal road/metaled road\" is used to describe an improved road surface that is made up of compacted materials like gravel, stone, or pavement. This type of road surface is typically found in areas with high traffic volume or in locations where the natural soil conditions are not suitable for a paved road. In some cases, metal roads can also refer to roads that are coated with a layer of asphalt or other bituminous materials. <br />The term \"metal road\" is believed to have originated in the early 19th century, when roads were first being improved with compacted materials like gravel and stone. At that time, the use of metal (usually iron or steel) was also becoming more common in road construction, as it was used to reinforce the roadbed or to create drainage ditches alongside the road. Over time, the term \"metal road\" came to be used as a general term for any improved road surface, regardless of the materials used. <br />Today, the term \"metal road/metaled road\" is still used in many parts of the world, particularly in Britain, to describe an improved road surface. In some cases, the term is used interchangeably with \"paved road\" or \"tarred road.\" However, in other cases, it may be used to specifically describe a road that is made up of compacted materials like gravel or stone, or a road that is coated with a layer of asphalt or other bituminous material.", "answer_b": "I’m far from an expert, but decided to look this up a bit.

{"question": "What's the deal with concubines in Ancient China?  How were they selected?  Were any selected from the common classes or were they generally from upper class families?  Was it shameful or a great honor for your daughter or sister to be selected as a concubine?", "answer_a": "In terms of what's the deal, I wrote a bit about [why a monogamous Emperor might not be a practical option](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l5b0m4/were_concubines_mandatory_to_have_in_imperial/gl44xim/) but in short, political ties to important families, increasing chances of children, cosmology to reflect Heaven and good medical practice with balancing yin and yang.<br />The later Han's selection process was that an officer of the imperial household and a eunuch, accompanied by a physiognomist, toured the capital area. They looked for ladies of virtue, beauty and respectable background (no crimes, magic, medicine, trade, handcraft) of between 13-20 sui. Leading families could either present their daughters to the inspectors or make arrangements to skip that, controllers and Dowagers inserting their own candidates (who just happened to be related). Also not unknown for an Emperor in the civil war when Han Empire collapsed  to spot someone they fancied, marriage via conquest, a \"we are sorry we rebelled, have this lady\"<br />In terms of background, the Later Han had background restrictions and any uncertainty, like with the He family who was the first from outside a certain seven families, could lead to rumours. But the Wei dynasty Empresses included a songstress (granted she became Empress after her husband died), an orphan servant (this led to some protest), a carriage maker's daughter (some sneering and protest), one from good background sent as a \"sorry we rebelled\". Policy towards those on the poor families depended on the dynasty, which families they wished to be aligned to, if they wanted to keep a distance from powerful families but there would be people from aristocratic backgrounds.<br />I'm unaware of anybody who felt it was shameful for their relative to enter the imperial harem.

{"question": "I realize The King’s Man was very much not a historically accurate movie.

{"question": "I have read on this subreddit before that it was not unheard of for medieval nuns writing about Jesus and God in very erotic, or seemingly erotic, terms. I was wondering if there is any compiled lists of this medieval thirst poetry or what are some more famous examples of it?", "answer_a": "Yes, this was absolutely a thing – and a reasonably widespread thing at that. Quite a lot of medieval religious women practiced aversion of mystical theology which incorporated a significant erotic element. This tended to revolve around casting Jesus as a bridegroom figure, with whomthe mystic envisioned themselves achieving spiritual, mystical union with. It’s worth noting that it was by no means only women practicing this kind of spiritual experience. Indeed, one of the most prominent examples of this practice is St Bernard of Clairvaux’s (1090-1153) sermons on the Song of Songs, in which he makes use of strongly sexualised imagery to describe union with Christ (and then promptly chastises his audience for their dirty minds – good consistentapproach there Bernard, A+).<br />However, it’s certainly the women who are the most famous for this practice, and it does seem to have been a largely female (andcertainly feminised) form of mysticism. To the best of my knowledge, there’s not a compiled list, simply because there’s a huge amount of the stuff. Poetry is prominent, but there’s also many prose accounts of mystical visions and experiences. There is an (important) caveat that the actual writer of these experiences can differ – in some cases it is the mystic herself, but in many other it’s a male (usually mendicant) confessor or spiritual director. This can be a very significant filter on the voice that we can access, and can play a part in homogenising or “flattening” the texts.<br />In terms of the content, “thirst poetry” is an interesting modern analogy, but it’s important to remember that the erotic content of works like this is (at least theoretically) very much the means to the end, which is complete and total union with the divine. Much mystical theology works in an apophatic way – this means that God is conceptualised as the ultimate negative, completely unknown and unknowable. Due to this fundamentally unreachable nature, a variety of intellectual strategies are employed to try and bridge this epistemological gap, of which the use of the erotic mode of expression is just one. It’s also worth noting that one could quite equally look at some of this “erotic” language and categorise it as being about violent behaviour instead. See for example Beatrice of Nazareth’s description of love:<br />*“Meantime, when love acts in the heart so vehemently and riotously, it becomes so excessive and exuberant in the soul that the soul thinks its heart has been wounded in many and grave ways.... So it seems that its veins are opened and its blood is boiling out, its marrow is withered and its legs are weak, its chest burns and its throat is dry.... And the soul thus feels love acting riotously within it, sparing nothing, uncontrollably seizing and consuming everything within the soul like a devouring fire…”*<br />Or Mechthild of Magdeburg’s description of the union with the Godhead:<br />*“She is captured in the first experience*  <br />*When God kisses her in sweet union.*  <br />*She is assailed with many a holy thought*  <br />*That she not waver when she mortifies her flesh.*  <br />*She is bound by the power of the Holy Spirit,*  <br />*And her bliss is indeed manifold.*  <br />*She is slapped with the great powerlessness*  <br />*Of not being able to enjoy without interruption eternal light”*<br />I’m not saying these works are *about* violence specifically, just that they’re not either uncomplicatedly erotic, or using eroticism as the primary meaning of the text.<br />Famous examples – probably the most widely known these days are Margery Kempe (experiencing something of a renaissance recently) and St Catherine of Siena. Examples do, however, multiply - Dorothea of Montau, Marguerite Porete, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch of Antwerp – the list goes on. I’d suggest that Kempe and St Catherine are probably the easiest to find editions of the complete text, though I’d not swear to that.<br />If you want some good reading on the subject, a classic text is C. Walker-Bynum, *Fragmentation and Redemption* (New York: Zone Books, 1992). A broader (and possibly more accessible) work is E. A.

This created a giant humanitarian crisis that the Union Army was ill-equipped to handle. Their best attempts were to put the freedmen into \"Contraband Camps\" that were rife with disease and unsanitary conditions. Another approach was to lease abandoned and confiscated plantations to Northern factors, who would then employ the freedmen to grow cotton. But in any case the crisis was never completely solved, and it proved to be a constant drain in Union resources and manpower, an embarrassment for the Lincoln administration, and a military factor in that the need to patrol the territory diverted thousands of troops and occasionally had adverse effects in military operations. <br />However, this was not an intentional ploy on the part of the Confederates. If they had gotten their way the Union would never have occupied those territories, and the people they enslaved would have remained in their plantations under their control. The freedmen who remained and thus came under Union protection did so not because of the Confederates but in spite of them, as they refused to flee with their masters. Instead, they abandoned the plantations and entered Union lines, or alternately, knowing that the Union would soon take control of the plantation, remained there, defying attempts to \"refugee\" them. Moreover, most of the outrage in reaction of the terrible conditions in the camps came from Northern abolitionists - people the Southerners despised.", "label": 2}

This isn't an issue when the carafe is less full.", "answer_a": "Roughly speaking, water doesn't like air, but does like glass (and some other things).<newline>So as you tip things the water clings to the glass so it touches as little air as possible and as much glass as possible.<newline>But once it gets flowing there is enough of a push to break that.", "answer_b": "There are a few reasons why water spills when first poured from full pitchers or carafes. One reason is that when the pitcher or carafe is full, the weight of the water can cause the spout to open slightly, which allows water to drip or spill out. Another reason is that when the container is full, the water level is higher than the spout, so the water has to travel further to reach the spout, which can cause it to spill or dribble out. Finally, when the container is full, the water is also under more pressure, which can cause it to spill or dribble out if the spout is not opened wide enough.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Why when holding a magnifying glass in a certain angle on a sunny day causes things like wood and cotton to burn? ", "answer_a": "Sunlight carries with it energy. About a thousand watts per square meter on a good day. A 6-cm magnifying glass takes up about 0.28% of a square meter, so it will be collecting around 2.8 watts of power - that's about a fifth of a small candle. It is concentrated down to a very small area - smaller than a candle flame, and so as far as that small area is concerned, it may as well be held over a flame.", "answer_b": "A magnifying glass works by gathering the light from a larger area and focussing it into a smaller area. When using a magnifying glass normally, you're taking the light bouncing off the thing you're looking at and focussing it into your eye-hole.<newline>If you bring a magnifying glass outside on a sunny day, [this happens](https://i.imgur.com/sJxraPg.png). All the sunlight (and heat energy) that hits the whole large surface of the magnifying glass gets focused and concentrated to be hitting a MUCH smaller point. So like, if you focus the power onto a spot 1/100th the size of the glass itself, that spot gets 100x more heat on it than just being in normal sunlight. Also notice you're not creating energy here. The hot spot gets a shadow around it. You're just moving and gathering most of the light that would have hit the circle and redistributing it into a much smaller spot and leaving a shadow around that spot.", "label": 2}
{"question": "what causes race cars to sometimes spin out when taking a turn? The only understanding I have is that applying too much throttle can be attributed to this, but how does increasing acceleration lead to a loss of control?", "answer_a": "So many things, surface condition, oversteer, understeer, condition of the tyres, cornering speed - bear in mind race cars usually operating on the very edge of grip - with the downforce they provide, so any marginal thing will likely cause it to “snap” and spin", "answer_b": "It depends on the type of car why they spun. Front wheel drive cars spin when you close the throttle mid turn. Rear wheel drive cars spin when you go too fast into it or accelerate too soon and all wheel drive cars do both but less often.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Why do heavy objects fall at the same speed as light ones? Shouldn't gravity make objects which mass is greater attract each other more and therefore touch each other more quickly? Or maybe the mass of the Earth is so big that the difference between two objects in perspective is negligible, especially on the very short distance between them and the soil? Not sure... could you explain?", "answer_a": "They do attract each other more, heavy objects fall with a greater force than light objects they just fall at the same velocity. The impact of a heavy object when it hits the ground is far greater, but force = mass times acceleration so the greater mass is balanced out by the greater force.", "answer_b": "Physics. Terminal velocity is a thing that matters a lot more than it seems. Also weight/mass while related, are two separate factors out of many factors that affect speed of falling objects. I’m definitely no physics person, but I believe that a heavier object needs more time to get to terminal velocity even though with enough time it will ultimately have a greater pull on it due to being heavier. A smaller object will reach terminal velocity more quickly, but it won’t go as fast. These two things exist on a parabola where there’s a lot of overlap because there’s often not a large enough free fall. Example of physics, an average sized human’s free fall terminal velocity is about 85-90mph, but a streamlined human can get to well over 100, and a human wearing specific clothing/attire can get even faster in a fall. That’s a variance of 60-70mph ultimately in an object that’s the same mass/size/relatively same shape just oriented differently or otherwise affecting drag.", "label": 1}
{"question": "how does a nuclear reactor and nuclear energy work? How does a nuclear reactor and nuclear energy work?", "answer_a": "A nuclear reactor uses radioactive materials as their fuel source. A chain reaction is started where neutrons slam into the other atoms which in turn also shoot off neutrons. But these neutrons are flying away at a high rate of speed, and they need to be slowed down a bit to make them more likely to hit another atom; this is where the moderator comes in. There are a few different things that can do this function, even just water.<newline>To control the reaction so they can make it happen more slowly over time instead of releasing all that insane energy at once, things such as control rods (which instead absorb neutrons instead of just slowing them down) are also put in the reactor.<newline>All this neutron whizzing about breaking other atoms like a cue ball on a pool table creates heat, crazy amounts of heat. This is captured via what is called the primary loop, which is water that is being circulated through the reactor both to help keep it cool and to collect that heat. This then goes to an exchanger where the primary water heats up secondary water (you don't want the primary water which is being exposed to neutron radiation to be outside the containment), and this secondary water gets turned into steam. This is what actually drives the steam turbines.<newline>Tldr: Nuclear reactions are atoms losing pieces that bump into other atoms and make them break up too, this makes shitloads of heat. The heat is collected and used for running a steam turbine.", "answer_b": "A nuclear reactor is a device used to initiate and control a nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used to generate electricity and to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. <newline><newline>Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to generate electricity. In a typical nuclear power plant, uranium fuel is enriched to about 3-5% U-235 and then formed into pellets. These pellets are then placed in fuel rods, which are bundled together to form a fuel assembly. <newline><newline>The fuel assembly is placed in the reactor core, where the nuclear fission reaction takes place. The fission reaction releases heat, which is used to generate steam. The steam turns turbines, which generate electricity. <newline><newline>Nuclear reactors are closely regulated to ensure the safety of the public and the environment. Nuclear power plants must meet strict safety and security regulations.", "label": 2}
{"question": "How is energy conserved when two forces counteract? If there are 2 forces on the same object, that counteract, the object doesn't move.<br />But there was energy released to create these forces. If these forces don't cause anything to move, doesn't it mean that that energy was destroyed?", "answer_a": "Applying perfectly opposite forces in a perfectly static and rigid world - doesn't actually expend any energy. The act of applying a force doesn't expend energy - its the act of applying a force over a distance which does.<newline>In the real world, since everything is elastic, the thing you are compressing/stretching with your forces, plus the structure that the forces are reacting against will act like stiff springs - and this is where the energy gets stored.<newline>For example press your hands together in front of your chest. As you press:<newline>* Some energy gets stored into the squishing of your palms<newline>* Some energy gets stored in the compression of the bones in your forearms<newline>* Some energy gets stored in the tension of your upper arms and the bones across your shoulders<newline>The chances are some energy will be lost to heat, since flesh is unlikely to be a particularly efficient elastic. <newline>Since you don't apply the force over much distance, very little energy is stored. If you put a spring between your hands, now you apply the force over more distance and more energy is stored (which is apparent when you let the spring go!)", "answer_b": "Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one type to another. In this case, the energy was converted from potential energy to kinetic energy and then back to potential energy. The object didn't move, so the kinetic energy was quickly converted back to potential energy.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Why can’t we dispose of nuclear waste by shooting it into deep space? ", "answer_a": "The main reason why we can't dispose of nuclear waste by shooting it into deep space is because it would be incredibly expensive to do so. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the waste would not eventually come back to Earth, potentially causing harm to our planet and its inhabitants.", "answer_b": "Cost. Currently to get mass into low earth orbit it costs many thousands of dollars per kg. We don't want to fill low earth orbit with waste so really we need it on at least an earth escape trajectory, and ideally a sun escape. This ramps up the cost even more. Storing nuclear waste is a hassle, but it isn't as expensive or dangerous as launching it into space.", "label": 2}
{"question": "what theories are out there about what came before the Big Bang? ", "answer_a": "The current model for what happened before the big bang is known as cosmic inflation.<newline>The basic idea is that the Big Bang on its own explains many of the observations made my scientists regarding the structure of the universe. However, what is interesting is that there are several observations that the Big Bang *cannot* explain, such as:<newline>\\- why was the universe \"born\" perfectly flat?<newline>\\- why is the universe the same temperature (up to over 99% accuracy) in all directions when there hasn't been enough time for the temperature of the universe to \"even out\" all the way?<newline>\\- why aren't there various high-energy relics (like magnetic monopoles - a magnet that's only North or South, but *not both*) when the Standard Model (the current frame work of the smallest particles in physics) predicted that such relics should exist as a result of the insanely high energy of the Big Bang?<newline>\\- why did the universe begin with such low entropy (which is a measure of \"disorder\" in a system)? Especially considering the fact that entropy always increases in closed systems?<newline>After the Big Bang model became accepted in the first half of the 1900's, scientists have struggled to answer these questions above according to the framework of the Big Bang.<newline>However, in the '70s and '80s a scientist named Alan Guth came up with a model explains everything the Big Bang did, *and* also explains the unsolved observations not accounted by the Big Bang. This model is known as cosmic inflation, and put simply it is the idea that the energy in the first moments of universe wasn't in particles or radiation, but in the fabric of space itself. So what happened *before* the Big Bang is that the fabric of space itself began to exponentially inflate to an unimaginable degree, and we call the \"Big Bang\" is actually the end of this inflationary period.<newline>So then that begs the question: what happened before the inflationary period? Sadly, no one knows. It is possible that some kind of singularity existed before inflation. It is also possible that inflation never stopped, which would imply the existence of a multiverse. Or it could be that inflations happen cyclically, which implies an eternal universe.<newline>What's really interesting here is that the scientists who figured out and basically proved that inflation came first did this forty years ago. So anyone who still tries to argue that the Big Bang was the first event in the universe is at least forty years outdated.", "answer_b": "Tesla said there is a primordial soup and we are being churned in it - that would be the big bang, the start of the churn, so the soup would be there but motionless, or the possibility of all motion, however you want to look at it.", "label": 1}
{"question": "how does a speaker vibrate at multiple frequencies simultaneously to deliver sounds to our ears? I'll try and explain what I mean.. say a song is playing - how do the vocals, drums, guitars etc which all have different frequencies (aka a plate is moving back &amp; forth at a rate to deliver these sound waves) play at the same time? Surely the plate can't vibrate to deliver two or more frequencies at once?", "answer_a": "This has been asked many times and the answer is they don’t. If you listen to the song being played live on purely acoustic instruments even though they are being played separately and emitting their own frequencies, what you hear (and by extension, what a microphone captures) at any given time is just ONE frequency that’s the “sum” of all the others combined. A speaker is just a reverse microphone.", "answer_b": "Imagine an ocean with a consistent wave. It flows up and down, with equal distance between the two waves at any time.<newline>Now imagine I push a larger, shorter wave into this ocean. The two waves will collide, resulting in some new wave pattern. This new wave pattern is a combination of those two waves.<newline>Speakers work similarly. If I combine two soundwaves, I get a new combination wave that sounds different.", "label": 1}
{"question": "How the bodies/remains from 9/11 couldn't be found/are \"just gone\" from a building collapse? ", "answer_a": "The most optimal range of a crematorium oven is 1400-1800 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures at ground zero were as high as 1377. So, while not optimal, it can still turn a body into dust over weeks (the fires burned for 100 days).", "answer_b": "There are a number of potential explanations for why the bodies/remains from 9/11 couldn't be found/are \"just gone\" from a building collapse. One possibility is that the bodies were completely incinerated in the intense heat of the collapse. Another possibility is that the bodies were pulverized by the force of the collapse.

{"question": "If light has no mass, why does it bend in the presence of gravity? ", "answer_a": "Light doesn’t have mass in the conventional sense. Einstein theorized, essentially, that there can be no energy without mass. If E= 0, and c^2 is a constant, then m= 0. If m=0, then there is no energy. Light IS energy.<newline>So! Light ACTS like it has mass while in motion, and has no mass when at a halt. The answer you’re looking for is: 🤷‍♂️", "answer_b": "Light travels in space. Gravity warps space, while light just keeps following wherever it goes. Although gravity doesn't affect photons, it does affect the surface upon which they move.", "label": 1}

{"question": "how can humans survive in the channel tunnel without a pressure suit? But no at that depth in sea? Is this down to the difference in density between air and water or is the air in the channel tunnel pressurised?", "answer_a": "The tunnel is only full of air, so going that deep isn't as big of a deal. Water weighs A LOT more, so at that depth there is more weight crushing you.", "answer_b": "Did a ctrl+f for pressure on the wikipedia page and found:<newline>> The ventilation system maintains the air pressure in the service tunnel higher than in the rail tunnels, so that in the event of a fire, smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the rail tunnels.<newline>So, yes there is a ventilation system that maintains the air pressure.<newline>> Trains travelling at high speed create piston effect pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort, ventilation systems, tunnel doors, fans and the structure of the trains, and which drag on the trains.[199] Piston relief ducts of 2-metre (7 ft) diameter were chosen to solve the problem, with 4 ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results.<newline>I found this pretty interesting. They had to install vents because the trains running into the air was causing pressure problems.", "label": 1}
{"question": "Since force is related to a change in momentum and not necessarily just to a change in velocity, what would be an example where only the mass of a body changes but not its velocity when subjected to a force? ", "answer_a": "Momentum is something that exists in mass. If you apply a force, it inherently *must* change an object's velocity (however slightly) and does not change its mass.<newline>To increase the momentum of an object, you must decrease the momentum of another object, as momentum is a conserved quantity. Note that momentum is a vector, and so a \"decrease\" could just as well mean an increase in the opposite direction. The force 'moves' momentum between the two objects.<newline>The force could, instead, move mass between the two objects, but the scenario is a bit odd, since the new mass isn't necessarily the same object but simply travels alongside the object.<newline>For example, imagine a very fast aircraft flying over enemy territory. So fast that it keeps pace with bullets. The enemy fires upon the aircraft, but the bullets can only match speeds with it and will not damage it. The bullets are now traveling with the aircraft, and with some mid-flight gluing they could become a part of it. In this case, the force of firing the bullet is pumping mass to the object without changing its velocity.", "answer_b": "My first thought was particle accelerators where the particles are close to the universal speed limit and will therefore not go any faster no matter how much acceleration you give them but will instead increase in mass. However /u/LordSpazpatty is completely right with the hovering rocket example as well as the mass is reduced due to fuel being burned by the engines requiring less force to keep the same acceleration.", "label": 2}
